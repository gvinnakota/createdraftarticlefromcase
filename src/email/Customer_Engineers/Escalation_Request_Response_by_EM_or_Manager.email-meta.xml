    <subject>Escalation Request Response by EM or Manager Case {!Case.CaseNumber}</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

My name is &lt;EM Name&gt;, I am an Escalation Manager with Pivotal. &lt;CE Name&gt; brought this issue to my attention, based on the business impact you identified. &lt;EM instructions&gt;Try and label the frustration expressed by the customer: examples - It sounds like the progress made so far is insufficient. / It sounds like responses have not been as quick as you expected. / etc.. &lt;/EM instructions&gt;

We discussed the current action plan with Support Management to make sure the actions we proposed are accurate and suitable. Please continue to work with &lt;CE Name&gt; on technical details as I will ensure the right people and resources are continuously engaged. I will also be monitoring all updates in this case. You may reach me via the contact information in my signature, should you feel your expectations are not being met.

Kind regards,
&lt;CE name&gt;</textOnly>
