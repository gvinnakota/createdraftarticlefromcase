    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Following our most recent actions and after reviewing all evidence, I believe it necessary to seek additional help from R&amp;D, and your case has now been escalated.

I expect to receive a response from Engineering with their initial review and feedback within &lt;CE to insert “30 minutes” for Sev 1 or “8 business hours” for other Sevs&gt;. This information and additional guidance will be included in my next case update.

Kind regards,

&lt;CE name&gt;</textOnly>
