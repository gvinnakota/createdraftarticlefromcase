    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

I am following up on your recent email requesting assistance to share the following information to help expedite any future requests.

Pivotal&apos;s support community provides the fastest result for known issues. Search here for articles and discussions: https://community.pivotal.io

Subscribers may also submit a case online. This is generally faster than requesting via email or phone. Please follow these instructions to register and open a case: https://content.pivotal.io/support/pivotal-support-for-subscribers

Kind regards,</textOnly>
