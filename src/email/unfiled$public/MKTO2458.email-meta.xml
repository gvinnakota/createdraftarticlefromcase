    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

IT departments within large organizations struggle with a common problem of infrastructure and operational management. Infrastructure components that support business-critical applications generate thousands of alerts per day. Additionally, thousands of incident tickets are created manually. Analyzing all of these alerts and incidents is both labor-intensive and expensive.

In this webinar &lt;http://w.on24.com/r.htm?e=848119&amp;s=1&amp;k=E7F0702F0E26F154BD0DDA18CB9E8485&amp;partnerref=pivotal&gt;, Regunathan 
Radhakrishnan (Principal Data Scientist, Pivotal) will present a framework that was developed to automatically cluster alerts to help IT departments understand the issues that keep their support personnel busy, determine the mean-time-to-repair for a group of alerts, and more. Join us &lt;http://w.on24.com/r.htm?e=848119&amp;s=1&amp;k=E7F0702F0E26F154BD0DDA18CB9E8485&amp;partnerref=pivotal&gt; to learn how these insights can help organizations improve their operational efficiency.
