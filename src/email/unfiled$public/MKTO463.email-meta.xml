    <subject>Introducing Casper - Action Needed by April 9</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello to all Pivotal employees!
Pivotal IT has a new tool in place to better manage our desktop &amp; laptop computers, called Casper. With Casper, IT will be able to support you with greater speed and efficiency &amp; provide security for Pivotal &amp; customer data.

We want to enroll every Pivotal computer, both Windows PC and Macs, into Casper by April 9, 2014. 

What You Need to do by April 9, 2014:

Step 1) You will receive an email invitation to enroll your computer with Casper. 
Step 2) Click the enrollment link from your work computer to enroll. 
Step 3) There is no step 3.

NOTE: If you work on a Pivotal Labs shared workstation, your local PivITs will work with project anchors to get shared computers enrolled. 

Details:

Clicking the enrollment link will install a small software component that will help us collect information about the specifications of the machine to better support you, but it will not make any other changes to your system and don&apos;t worry - it 
will not do any NSA-type monitoring. Installation will only take a few minutes.

Once you receive your invitation email, please take a few minutes to enroll your computer.

If you have questions, or run into issues enrolling your computer, please email askIT@gopivotal.com &lt;mailto:askIT@gopivotal.com&gt; for assistance.  
 
Regards,
