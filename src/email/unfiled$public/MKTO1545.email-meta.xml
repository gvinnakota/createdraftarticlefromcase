WEBINAR: SCALE OUT YOUR BIG DATA APPS: THE LATEST ON PIVOTAL GEMFIRE AND GEMFIRE XD
Join us on November 18th for Pivotal and RedMonk’s web seminar: Made for Each Other: Microservices + PaaS, where you will learn how to architect your applications for rapid innovation. Microservices are becoming the cloud architecture of choice because they offer the ability to loosely couple applications into discrete services that can be surgically changed without requiring disruptive overhauls. This approach enables the responsiveness and rapid change needed by the business. Enterprise PaaS is a critical foundation to simplify the operations, governance, and health management of these new architectures. Together with a DevOps culture, microservices and PaaS are the engine that drives innovation at speed.

Join us this week for The Mobile Experience - Episode #6 of our ongoing podcast series.

They&apos;re full of photos, updates, emails, and occasionally we do make a phone call with them. Using phones exclusively for apps is really, really interesting.

Last week, hundreds of start-ups, tech visionaries and the likes of Eva Longoria, Tony Hawk, and Bono descended on this vibrant city to talk shop, share grand ideas, and explore what’s next in tech. Sponsoring for the first year, Pivotal Vice President and COO of Pivotal Labs Edward Hieatt’s keynote proved to be a Pivotal and Summit highlight. With just over 500 people in the audience, Edward talked about how enterprises can and should “rediscover software development.” Underscoring Marc Andreessen&apos;s now well-cited dictum on “Why Software is Eating the World”, he illustrated how enterprises are no longer entitled to their own business model. Much of the disruption we have seen has come from start-ups who have leveraged cheap infrastructure, storage, networking and open source technology in the cloud – all of which has allowed them to run their businesses with software at the core.
