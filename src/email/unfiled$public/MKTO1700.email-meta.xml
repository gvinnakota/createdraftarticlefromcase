    <subject>Pivotal Town Hall - Please Submit Your Questions!</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Colleagues,

Our Pivotal Town Hall gathering is this Thursday, December 18th from 9am to 10am PST. The meeting will be held in Palo Alto and also available via live video stream &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/pivotal-town-hall/&gt;.

For the first 20 minutes, Paul, Bill, 
Scott, and Rob will share their thoughts on recent organizational changes, exciting momentum in each of our three businesses, and the current progress on locking down our 2015 plan-of-record.

The remainder of the meeting will be dedicated to answering questions from all of 
you. We want to get to as many of your questions as we can, so please submit your questions in advance to townhall@pivotal.io &lt;mailto: townhall@pivotal.io&gt;.

Thank you!
