Data Silos to Data Lakes
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
IT departments have long applied a strong discipline to managing, storing and protecting enterprise data. But, as we move into the age of Big Data and Cloud, this era of traditional application or organization-centric data silos is nearing its end. The evolution from data silos to information infrastructure ecosystems, known as data lakes, will accelerate data-driven insights, application development and time to value. 
 
The latest installment in the Pivotal Data Labs Webinar Series &lt;http://bit.ly/1hzN9AX&gt; will focus on the impact of data lakes and how IT can architect and utilize them to achieve business goals. After an overview of data lake concepts, Ken Dowling (Principal Data Engineer, Pivotal) will review the technology stack for data lake deployments. Example solution architectures and data flows for successful implementation will also be presented. Join us to learn more about how data lakes are helping organizations secure strategic advantages and improve their bottom line.
