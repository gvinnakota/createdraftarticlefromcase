    <subject>You&apos;re Invited: 2015 Kick-off Celebrations</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi Team,

I’m very pleased to announce that in 2015, Pivotal will host a number of “Kick-Off” celebration events in major office locations across the world, both to celebrate your hard work and to get us going for the year ahead.

These gatherings and parties have traditionally been referred to as “Holiday” or “Year-End” parties, and this year, instead of holding events during the busy end-of-year period, we’ll be holding them all as 2015 Kick-Off events. All events will be held in early Q1, sometime between January 16th and February 13th, culminating with the final event -- our Worldwide Sales Kick-Off in San Francisco, February 17th - 20th.

More information on event dates and locations will be coming your way soon. For those of you not near a major Pivotal location, please check in with your manager regarding smaller local events. Should you have any questions please send a note to ask@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:ask@pivotal.io&gt;.

Thank you again for the hard work, and for all you do.

Here’s to an outstanding 
2015!</textOnly>
