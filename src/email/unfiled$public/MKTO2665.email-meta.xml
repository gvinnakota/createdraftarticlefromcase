    <subject>A Great First Half and a Thank You</subject>
    <textOnly>Team,

It’s hard to believe that we’ve just hit the halfway mark in our 2015 fiscal year. Time flies when you’re having fun, and what’s better than closing business and focusing on the three P’s - Productivity, Pipeline and Platform? 

While we can provide specifics on our results later in July and in tandem with EMC earnings, you may be wondering if that disciplined focus on the three P’s is helping us grow, and boldly be all that Pivotal can be. I can say without a doubt that it has. We had an outstanding first half, and every one of you should be extremely proud of our accomplishments.

We had big time wins in Q2 with the likes of State Farm, Charles Schwab, FBI, Daimler, Dish, Telstra, JPMC, Comcast, Ford, and Murex to name just a few. It’s pretty amazing to see the growing uptake across the banking, insurance, auto, manufacturing, government, and media and entertainment, and other sectors. Now that is broad-based platform adoption!

Thank you! It has been my privilege to work for each and every one of you. 

Like any market-facing team, we reset the clock and begin to make the new quarter and second half happen in a big way. We’ve shown that we can jump out of the gates at full gallop, which has put us in a terrific place for Q3. All of you have an amazing opportunity to deliver a truly memorable 2015 for Pivotal. Keep these priorities in mind as you proceed: 

 - Expand that base: Capitalize on our clear product momentum to win more logos and expand our footprint and influence. 
 - Drive adoption: Ensure a great user experience, which helps you position opportunities to cross-sell more of our portfolio to our current base.
 - Productivity: Paramount for deal velocity. We’ve invested heavily in education, so everyone in the field can work to skill up and get better every day.


Despite the triumphs - and my focus on the close, as my final quarter with all of you, it’s difficult for me to close out this note. It’s been a hard decision for me, but on a personal level, it’s the right one. I do feel good about our momentum at this point, and leaving things in the capable hands of Bill Cook and our field leadership. 

I’ll always consider myself part of the team, and as a shareholder will be cheering you all on! Once again, thank you for a tremendous effort in the first half. I look forward to watching your success in Q3 and beyond!

BE BOLD!</textOnly>
