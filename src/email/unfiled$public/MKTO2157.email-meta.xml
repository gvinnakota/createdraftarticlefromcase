Driving Innovative Citizen Outcomes with the Internet of Things


What are the implications of the Internet of Things (IOT) for Government - for how it does its business and delivers its services? What are the policy and regulatory implications?



Suzanne Roche, AIIA General Manager Policy and Advocacy will explore the implications and opportunities of the IOT for Government. Suzanne will provide an overview of these issues, drawing on the outcomes of the AIIA Internet of Things Summit to be held at the end of March.



Gavin Jones, General Manager for Pivotal will then look at the new technologies available to government to drive that innovation utilizing the Internet of Things. Gavin will look to global examples of what IOT can deliver.
