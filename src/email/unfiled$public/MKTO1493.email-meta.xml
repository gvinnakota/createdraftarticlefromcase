    <subject>Expanding Pivotal Wi-Fi to more EMC offices</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi All,

We’re always looking for ways to improve how you connect to Pivotal networks. In partnership with the EMC Federated Services team, we’re expanding the coverage of Pivotal Wi-Fi services to more EMC shared offices. At the same time, EMC IT is updating Wi-Fi access points with the latest version of software to fix minor issues and keep them up-to-date.

The EMC IT team is updating Wi-Fi networks in EMC shared offices, starting at 9:00 am ET on Saturday, November 8th, 2014.  The work should be completed by 5:00 pm ET.



 - 
During the update window, you should expect intermittent Wi-Fi service interruptions at EMC shared offices, including the Pivotal Wi-Fi service.   If you must work in an EMC shared office during this update window, we suggest you use a wired network connection and make sure you are setup with zScaler &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/pivotal-it/emc-systems/zscaler-proxy-setup&gt; to get to all your Google Apps.






 - 
When the work if finished, Pivots will have unrestricted access to Google Apps in even more shared EMC offices, just by connecting to Pivotal Wi-Fi &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/pivotal-it/emc-systems/pivotal-wifi&gt;.




If you run into any issues or have any questions, please don&apos;t hesitate to email ask@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:ask@pivotal.io&gt; so we can give you a hand.

Thanks,

Brian Murray and Ryan Van Aken</textOnly>
