    <subject>Q3 Field Accreditation and Pivotal Academy Update</subject>
    <textOnly>Team,

Today we are launching two big Field Enablement initiatives – Q3 Field Accreditation, and the new Pivotal Academy Field Enablement site.  Now you’ll be able to get to all your Field Enablement training in one, centralized location…without requiring EMC VPN access! 

 The focus of Q3 Field Accreditation will be developing your ability to create PaaS and Big Data opportunities, 
and to refine your customer-facing messaging fluency for these strategic revenue drivers. We’re expecting to see 100% completion of the Q3 Accreditation courses and quizzes across the global field – from both Sales and Field Engineering – by August 8th (three weeks to complete these). Details are provided below.

 As a reminder, we will be following these Accreditation courses with the launch of our Pivotal Ready skills development program in August. This Q3 initiative will pair an exciting set of new deliverables: Customer-facing Data and PaaS whiteboards, with regional Stand-and-Deliver workshops. The goal is to build your skills and confidence in telling the Data and PaaS stories so you can create, execute, and close these important opportunities. You’ll see more details on that in the coming weeks.

For now, you need to dive in and get started on completing the Q3 Accreditation courses. The details:

 - Access the Q3 Accreditation 
 - Go to the Pivotal Academy main landing page &lt;http://pivotal.biglms.com/&gt; (Bookmark!)
 - Select Field Enablement,
 - You will be asked to complete a Pivotal Academy registration
 - Once completed, you will be passed through to the Field Enablement main landing page (Bookmark this page!)
 - Select the “Enablement Programs” drop down from the navigation bar in the upper right
 - From the drop down menu select “Accreditation”

 - Q3 Accreditation Details and Expectations 

 - Select either of the Q3 Accreditation badges on the landing page to get to the course links

 - You will need to complete the 9 courses listed there, as well as their associated quizzes with an 80% score or better. 

 - Big Data Introduction:  Why Big Data Matters (45 minutes)
 - How to Sell Big Data Suite (4-part series – 20-30 minutes per)
 - Pivotal CF Product Training (30 minutes)
 - How to Sell Pivotal CF (3-part series – 20-30 minutes per)

 - If you feel you have sufficient knowledge on a topic, you can go straight to the test and “test-out” by successfully achieving a score of 80% or better.
 - Deadline:  All courses and quizzes must be completed by August 8th.

As always, the Executive team and I are here to support your efforts to build the pipe, execute smoothly, and collect those logos.

Make it happen!
