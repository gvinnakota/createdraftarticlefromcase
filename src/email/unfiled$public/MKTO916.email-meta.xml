    <subject>How well is your tomcat environment supported?</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Did you know Pivotal employs the leading code committers for Tomcat?  This means we provide the best support for Tomcat or our enterprise version - Pivotal tc Server &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/products/pivotal-tc-server&gt;.

If you answer yes to any of the following questions, then please follow-up with me for an in-depth discussion on tc Server/Tomcat:
 


 - Do you need timely upgrades for security vulnerabilities?
 - Do you need guaranteed response times and global 24x7 support?
 - Do you need code level monitoring for your applications?
 - Do you need intellectual property indemnification?
 - Do you struggle provisioning large Tomcat deployments?


Let me know when you&apos;re free to touch base.

 Thanks and have a great day, 

Estevan
