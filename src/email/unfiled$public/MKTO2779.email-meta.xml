Colleagues,

The second quarter of 2015 marked the best quarter financially in the history of our company!

Before we dive into the second half, we want to acknowledge everyone’s hard work and dedication. Our upcoming Town Hall on August 18th in San Francisco will be special. We’ll celebrate how far we’ve come, and make a few key announcements.

Even though we’re scattered across the globe, the sense of who we are as a company is strong everywhere. So wherever you are, show your passion for Pivotal on the 18th, by wearing your favorite Pivotal t-shirt to the Town Hall. 

We encourage all employees in the Bay Area to join us live in San Francisco. If you’re coming from our Palo Alto office, there is still room to sign up for the event shuttle bus &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/forms/d/1EJNqwcazufZ0cp0dfht16pDxaOrj3W6J8t_tp3pgY-E/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1&gt;.

Happiness Directors across Pivotal offices will also be setting up Town Hall viewing parties to help us celebrate as one team. The Town Hall event will be streamed live for all employees here &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/pivotal-town-hall&gt;.
