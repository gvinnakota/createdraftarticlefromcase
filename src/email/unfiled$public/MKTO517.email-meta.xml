    <subject>An Important Message from Field Operations</subject>
    <textOnly>Global Field Operations Team,
It has been a very busy and exciting quarter for us in Field Operations, and we have quite a few updates that we would like to share with you. With that being said, please take the time to read the communication carefully; as there are a number of policies and process changes that you should be aware of. 

What’s New
Salesforce.com Clean-Up will be taking place April 15-16 and we need your help!  All reps will be expected to clean-out bad data in SFDC, making the tool and the data that lives there more accurate for us 
to leverage as a company. 

ACTION: We have created several reports in the SFDC Clean Up Project Folder, located under the reports tab in SFDC. On April 15th-16th (or before) you are expected to log into SFDC and update your opportunities to remove all bad data. All report links, as well as specific instruction may be  found here &lt;https://drive.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/file/d/0B7uO4XIa64ANX3NWcVNwakkxWUk/edit?usp=sharing&gt;. Ops will audit on the 17th to ensure completion.

 
Pivotal April Price List &amp; Q2 Product Availability is now available for you on our Inside Pivotal Page here &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AruO4XIa64ANdGVNUW00d2F0NWZ0TGhzTGJrSkFkNFE&amp;usp=sharing&gt;. The list shows what Pivotal products are available, where they may be sold and where they may be fulfilled. Service SKUs will be added in and available in May. Pivotal&apos;s Big Data Suite will also be available at EMC in the coming weeks. 
Pivotal&apos;s Quote to Cash (QTC) system for Direct Orders is scheduled to go live April 14th with the incremental ability to sell, fulfill and support Pivotal software and services directly as Pivotal. With Pivotal Network, we are helping establish ourselves as an independent company and enabling a more direct/personal relationship between Pivotal and our customers. 
The new system, Pivotal Network, will go live in the US and Mexico on the 14th, and internationally soon after. In the meantime, all International orders will continue to flow through EMC or VMware as they do today. Our new QTC system has no effect on our GTM, which remains the same. EMC will also continue to be heavily leveraged as a critical GTM partner, as well as from back office support and a quote to cash systems capacity. As we introduce the system, direct orders will be phased in gradually, on a case-by-case basis with Deal Desk approval required. Both EMC and Pivotal customers will be directed to Pivotal Network for electronic fulfillment of Pivotal product and Pivotal Support for support of Pivotal product. For questions on Pivotal Network, please contact pivotal-deal-desk@gopivotal.com &lt;mailto:pivotal-deal-desk@gopivotal.com&gt;.
Register for Pivotal Network. Starting April 14th, any customer may go to Pivotal Network to evaluate our full portfolio of products. We encourage you to log in and familiarize yourself with the system at https://network.gopivotal.com &lt;https://network.gopivotal.com/&gt;. Pivotal and EMC customers will be directed to Pivotal Network to download their licensed. Sales of Pivotal product through VMware will continue to be delivered through the VMware customer portal.
Pivotal Support.  Customers purchasing Pivotal Products through EMC and Pivotal post 4/14 are entitled to register and receive support through Pivotal’s webpage here &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/support&gt;. Click on any given product, and then click “submit a ticket”. Customer can also participate in Forums and access Knowledgebase Articles through the Pivotal Support site. Legacy EMC and &quot;ALL&quot; VMware customers are still required to access support through 
the below referenced channels. As a reminder, please note that Open Source Support Only Contracts, primarily Spring, are to be registered as Support, not Subscription. We have had a few questions so wanted to be clear here.
Legacy Support Options:
EMC
Web: https://support.emc.com &lt;https://support.emc.com/&gt;
Phone: 800-SVC-4EMC 
VMware
Web: https://my.vmware.com &lt;https://my.vmware.com/&gt;
Phone: 877-486-9273
Selling the Big Data Suite Update. The Big Data suite is available and may be sold through the Pivotal and EMC channel. While a SKU is not yet finalized, this should not hinder you from selling. Please contact the pivotal-deal-desk@gopivotal for questions selling the Big Data suite.
Clarification of T&amp;E on Services Orders: Pivotal will not include T&amp;E on Services orders as part of compensation.
Thank you in advance for your cooperation and continued support of these policies, procedures and new systems are put into place.
