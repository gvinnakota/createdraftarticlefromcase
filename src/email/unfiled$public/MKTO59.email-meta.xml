Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Thank you for downloading Pivotal HD Community. We hope your experience is going well and you are seeing the advantages of Hadoop. 
 
We wanted to inform you that HAWQ’s native, mature and fast SQL query engine for Hadoop is now freely available for download &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/pivotal-products/pivotal-data-fabric/pivotal-hd#4&gt; with your Pivotal HD Community deployment for a 60-day free trial. 
 
Add the following benefits of HAWQ to Pivotal HD Community: 

 - A Parallel Query Optimizer - 10 years of innovation in MPP, HAWQ delivers unmatched query optimization that decisively outperforms alternatives.
 - Dynamic Pipelining - a parallel data flow framework, which implements all the operations that underlie all SQL queries.
 - Pivotal Extension Frameworks - allows you to run and integrate directly with data sets stored in Hadoop HDFS via MapReduce, Hbase or Hive, cutting latency and reducing duplication or movement of data.
 - Advanced Analytics Functions - a library of parallelized analytics algorithms (MADLib) to speed analytics development and execution.
