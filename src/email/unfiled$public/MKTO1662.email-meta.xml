EPISODE #9: USING PIVOTAL CF FOR BLUE/GREEN DEPLOYMENT, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 3RD
&lt;http://pivotal.io/podcasts&gt;
Join us &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/podcasts&gt; this week for &apos;Using Pivotal CF for Blue/Green Deployment&apos;, Episode #9 of our ongoing podcast series.

Getting new features into the hands of your customers sounds great, but it can be a little trickier than it looks. How do you ensure that a change does not “break” the system? How do you roll-back if something bad happens? How do you deploy a change so that no traffic is lost, packets are dropped or transactions missed?

Fortunately Pivotal CF provides built-in capability to handle this complexity for you. In this episode, we will dive more deeply into the concept of Blue/Green deployments, and the mechanism used by Pivotal CF to deploy changes into production with zero downtime and no packets dropped!
