    <textOnly>Pivotal Open Source Hub (POSH): Hands-on Virtual Meetup for Apache Geode #1 - Getting Started
Speakers: Catherine Johnson &amp; Luke Shannon, Pivotal

In-memory computing for data-driven applications has entered a new renaissance with powerful frameworks and technologies becoming available in open source. The newest addition is Apache Geode, the open source in-memory data grid that forms the core of Pivotal GemFire. Apache Geode allows Java and Spring Developers to add enterprise class in memory data management via Java APIs as well as the Spring Data GemFire framework.

Hands-on Virtual Meetups for Apache Geode are technical tutorial webinars that demonstrate how to use in-memory data grid technologies, and how to add these capabilities to your applications.

Join us for our first webinar in the series: #1 - Getting Started. In this session we will cover:


 - In-memory data grid introduction and &amp; architecture 
 - Technical use cases 
 - How to get and install Apache Geode 
 - How to set up an Apache Geode cluster and enter data into the system 
 - How to stop an Apache Geode cluster 
 - Example: Using Apache Geode via Spring Data GemFire 
 - Q&amp;A 



We look forward to having you join us!
