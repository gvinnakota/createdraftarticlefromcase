    <subject>Spring Webinars: Spring Integration 4.0 - The New Frontier and Data-Driven Apps with Spring and Neo4j</subject>
    <textOnly>Spring Integration 4.0 - The New Frontier
The Spring Integration team has been hard at work on the latest release of the popular integration framework. Before version 4.0, it was impractical to define a complete Spring Integration flow without using XML. With this major release, the existing basic annotation support has received an overhaul and those who prefer to use java @Configuration classes can now define their applications without needing to use any XML (of course, XML is still supported as well).
 
In this session we will cover these major changes to the framework, explaining how and when to use them. It will be mainly demonstration and code walk through, and we will build a useful Spring Boot / Integration application from scratch.)

Data-Driven Applications with Spring and Neo4j
Speakers: Josh Long (Pivotal) and Michael Hunger (Neo Technology)

Spring Data Neo4j 3.0 is here and it supports Neo4j 2.0. Neo4j is a tiny graph database with a big punch. Graph databases are imminently suited to asking interesting questions, and doing analysis. Want to load the Facebook friend graph? Build a recommendation engine? Neo4j&apos;s just the ticket. Join Spring Data Neo4j lead Michael Hunger (@mesirii) and Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long (@starbuxman) for a look at how to build smart, graph-driven applications with Spring Data Neo4j and Spring Boot.
