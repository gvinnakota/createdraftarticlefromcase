    <subject>Introducing Pivotal.io</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi Team,

On July 28th, Pivotal will publicly launch a new domain for the whole company: www.pivotal.io &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/pivotal-io&gt; The new domain will cover our websites and 
services, and include internal Google Apps and assets such as Drive, Sites, Gmail, etc. IT will begin a phased migration to pivotal.io &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/pivotal-io&gt; from gopivotal.com &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com&gt; and pivotallabs.com &lt;http://www.pivotallabs.com&gt; starting this month through the July 28 launch date. 

We’ve come a long way in one year, bringing together exceptional talent and tech to create Pivotal, a unique formula that 
we believe is the best response to helping enterprises tackle their most important business issues in a new era. As we grow and influence markets, we owe it to everyone here to make it easier to work across teams. The different domains in use today create confusion and slow things down, both for our teams, and for customers and stakeholders.

The new pivotal.io &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/pivotal-io&gt; will 
make it easier for us to get things done -- to book rooms with a single calendar or connect in social forums from a common domain. It will also give our stakeholders a clear, common reference point through a domain associated with fresh thinking and a start-up culture.

Pivotal is also unique in that we brought together businesses that were successful in their own right. While a common domain will create a fresh web presence and improve the Google Apps experience, it does not mean a change for brands that are important to Pivotal’s business. Pivotal Labs is one such case, and assets strongly associated with Pivotal Labs, such as the Labs public website, or Labs signage in offices, will not change.

Chris Curtis from IT will follow shortly with a note providing details on what you can expect from IT on the transition. In the meantime, please visit the Inside Pivotal landing page &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/pivotal-io&gt; for pivotal.io &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/pivotal-io&gt;, which includes a detailed FAQ and information on helpful resources. Finally, a big thanks goes to Pivotal IT for doing the heavy lifting to ensure that this proceeds smoothly. Stay tuned for more details.
