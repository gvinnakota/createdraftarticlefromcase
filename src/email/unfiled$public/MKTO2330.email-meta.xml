 - Building Microservices with Spring Cloud and Netflix OSS 

 - Speaker: Dr. David Syer, Pivotal 
 
 Now that you have Cloud Foundry, what are you going to do with it? This presentation will show using Spring Cloud on Cloud Foundry to quickly leverage common microservice patterns, including distributed configuration management, service discovery, intelligent 
routing, load balancing, and fault tolerance. Using Spring Cloud on Cloud Foundry, developers can take advantage of the cloud native microservice architectures pioneered by those building the web at places like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Netflix. In many cases they can do so running the same code with Spring Cloud wrapping the same battle-tested open source components those companies are running in production. 
 
This is just one of the many sessions and hands on workshops from Pivotal speakers that will address topics in Spring, Cloud Native Applications, Big Data, Groovy, and Grails. Check out the full agenda of 38 great speakers from Pivotal, Google, Vaadin, JetBrains, Neo Technology, MongoDB, Couchbase, ElasticSearch, ZeroTurnAround, AppDynamics, Magnolia and more.</textOnly>
