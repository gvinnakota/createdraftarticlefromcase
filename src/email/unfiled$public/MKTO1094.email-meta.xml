Learn alongside enterprise open source leaders &lt;https://2014.event.springone2gx.com/schedule/sczkrq&gt;
SpringOne2GX is where the cutting edge Java developers are. Join us at the conference to learn about Pivotal&apos;s vision for micro service architecture, Big Data, Cloud, and all things Spring, Groovy, Grails. Whether you&apos;re building and running mission-critical business applications, designing the next killer cloud or big data application, SpringOne 2GX will help you learn alongside the leaders of the enterprise Java community. BONUS! Two-Day Immersion Training &lt;http://springone2gx.com/training&gt; for Hadoop and Cloud Foundry is being offered this year before the show for only $200.00 USD! (Details below.)

FEATURED SESSION with MATT STINE and FRED MELO

 Developing Microservices for PaaS with Spring and Cloud Foundry &lt;https://2014.event.springone2gx.com/schedule/sessions/developing_microservices_for_paas_with_spring_and_cloud_foundry.html&gt;
 Marc Andressen has famously said &quot;Software is eating the world.&quot; What does that mean? We take it to mean that multiple industries with historically entrenched leaders are being disrupted by businesses built around a software core. These software factories are characterized by:

 - tight feedback loops 
 - rapid iteration 
 - horizontal scaling 
 - mobile-first UX 
 - continuous delivery 

These factors have contributed to drive a change in how we approach infrastructure, which has taken the lead in adapting to meet these needs with the move to the cloud, and Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings like Cloud Foundry have raised the level of abstraction to a focus on an ecosystem of applications and services. However, most applications are still developed as if we&apos;re living in the previous generation of both business and infrastructure: the monolithic application. Microservices - small, loosely coupled applications that follow the Unix philosophy of &quot;doing one thing well&quot; - represent the application development side of enabling rapid, iterative development, horizontal scale, polyglot clients, and continuous delivery. They also enable us to scale application development and eliminate long term commitments to a single technology stack. While microservices are simple, they are certainly not easy. It&apos;s recently been said that &quot;microservices are not a free lunch.&quot; Interestingly enough, if you look at the concerns typically expressed about microservices, you&apos;ll find that they are exactly the challenges that a PaaS is intended to address. So while microservices do not necessarily imply cloud (and vice versa), there is in fact a symbiotic relationship between the two, with each approach somehow compensating for the limitations of the other, much like the practices of eXtreme Programming do the same. This session will describe architectural patterns for developing microservices:

 - Service Decomposition 
 - API Gateways 
 - Stateless / Shared-Nothing Apps 
 - Configuration and Backing Service Consumption 
 - Fault Tolerance

Along the way we&apos;ll see how to leverage technologies such as Spring Boot and Reactor to develop microservices targeted at Cloud Foundry. 

Huge Discount on Immersion Training at the show!

If you select a registration package that includes the $200 two-day Immersion Training &lt;http://springone2gx.com/training&gt;, you will be contacted to select one of the three options. You must attend only one of the Immersion Trainings for September 7-8, 2014. Day 2 training on September 8, 2014 will end before the official start of activities for SpringOne 2GX 2014.

 -  Developing Applications for the Cloud, Immersion Training (Sunday &amp; Monday - Sep 7 &amp; 8, 2014) 
 -  Pivotal Cloud Foundry for Operators, Immersion Training (Sunday &amp; Monday - Sep 7 &amp; 8, 2014) 
 -  Hadoop for Developers, Immersion Training (Sunday &amp; Monday - Sep 7 &amp; 8, 2014)

 This is a one-of-a-kind conference for application developers, solution and data architects who develop business applications, create multi-device aware web applications, process vast quantities of enterprise data, design cloud architectures, and manage high performance infrastructure. The sessions are specifically tailored for developers using the hugely popular open source Spring IO Projects, Groovy &amp; Grails, CloudFoundry, Apache Hadoop and Tomcat technologies. Whether you&apos;re building mission-critical web or business applications, crunching huge amounts of distributed data, or designing the next killer cloud application, SpringOne 2GX will keep you up to date with the latest enterprise technology. 

 Featuring presentations delivered by development leads, committers, and published authors, it&apos;s the ideal place to obtain critical skills to help you design, build and run tomorrow&apos;s software solutions. Plus you&apos;ll meet and learn from open source leaders &lt;https://2014.event.springone2gx.com/presenters&gt; who drive innovation for these technologies.

See you there,
