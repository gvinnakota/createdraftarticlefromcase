    <subject>Webinar: Operationalizing Data Analytics with Pivotal and Forrester</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Enterprises with Hadoop deployments still have yet to fully realize the business benefits of the platform. In this webinar, Pivotal and Forrester will explore: 

 - What is needed to transform initial investments into results, and how the right tools and solutions can help address and overcome challenges.
 - Shifts in the industry with regards to SQL and NoSQL systems and their implications to enterprises investing in Big Data analytics.
 - The emergence of in-memory data management systems for data analytics and transactional processing, in-memory operational databases, and what the future holds for these systems.

Join us &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/big-data/pivotal-forrester-operationalizing-data-analytics-webinar&gt; on January 14 for Forrester’s market perspective, Pivotal’s portfolio perspective, and apply both to drive strategy in 2015 and beyond.
