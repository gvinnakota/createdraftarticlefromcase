    <subject>Pivotal Subscription &amp; Services Program is Live!</subject>
    <textOnly>To All Pivotal Employees,

I am happy to announce that Pivotal’s Subscription &amp; Services Transformation Program has gone live!

With the new implementations, Pivotal makes great strides towards having scalable, public-company quality operations. The program will allow Pivotal greater flexibility in delivering subscription software and services to our customers, while also providing Pivotal with enhanced agility in taking our products to market directly.  The updates will augment our subscription management capabilities and help us better understand customers through visibility, metrics and analytics.

Core features of the program include:


 - A new quoting module within Salesforce, complete with pricing approvals and order management capabilities
 - A new subscription billing system (Zuora) for consolidated invoicing and a standalone financial subledger
 - A new, streamlined instance of OpenAir to allow for greater operational visibility to our professional services while minimizing Pivot impact
 - A single product catalog with integration to Salesforce



Thanks again for your support of the Subscription &amp; Services Transformation Program and of Pivotal’s evolving IT and Operations journey.

Best,
