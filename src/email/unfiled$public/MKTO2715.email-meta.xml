    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}}, 

Thanks for visiting Pivotal at the Data Science Summit in San Francisco. We hope you enjoyed learning about how enterprises are using data science to drive modern software experiences for their customers.

In the Pivotal session at the event, Principal Data Scientist, Rashmi Ragu &lt;http://conf.dato.com/speakers/rashmi-raghu/&gt; provided a unique look at how organizations are starting to get value from the Internet Of Things (IoT) and analyzed the implications of IoT for the enterprise. The presentation slides are available here &lt;http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/data-science-case-studies-the-internet-of-things-implications-for-the-enterprise&gt;.
