    <textOnly>Using Reactor for Asynch/non-blocking Microservices
Speaker: Stephane Maldini 

 What is the role of asynchronous, non-blocking style-communication in microservices? Join Stephane Maldini for a revealing look at why reactive components are so important in an eventually-consistent approach like microservice architecture. When services own their data and are completely independent, having a (reactive) abstraction layer can perform a variety of roles. Being able to parallelize resources a microservice owns is an important technique. Another might be as an event bus, pulling state data from various micro services dynamically, checking against the cached, fairly up-to-date local copy. 
 
 While a microservice has “all” the data it needs from other services to respond to a request, this data is not necessarily up-to-date—an important constraint to be prepared to accept. Stephane will also discuss other async use cases outside of microservices and how www.reactive-streams.org &lt;http://www.reactive-streams.org&gt; protocol support allows levels of portability across vendor implementations.

Building Scalable Data Applications with Spring and GemFire
Speaker: Luke Shannon
 
 GemFire is Pivotal&apos;s distributed In Memory Data grid. In this session we will cover simplifying configuring a GemFire grid using Spring Data GemFire, and explore how data is dynamically distributed and made highly available as the grid resources are increased or decreased to meet increased client demand. GemFire access and testing patterns using Spring will be reviewed in detail. 
 
 We will walk through creating a domain object and using Spring Data GemFire Repositories to perform CRUD operations on a GemFire grid, creating a Spring MVC/Spring Boot application that uses GemFire as its persistence layer, review how Spring Boot and Spring Data GemFire can be used to help with GemFire test cases and how Spring Data GemFire can make creation and execution of GemFire functions easier. We will also explore how Spring XD can be used to load and monitor data changes in the grid. This will be a hands on, code oriented session.

Introducing the Java DSL for Spring Integration
Speaker: Gary Russell
 
 The Spring Integration JavaConfig and DSL extension provides a set of convenient Builders and a fluent API to configure Spring Integration message flows from Spring @Configuration classes. The Java DSL for Spring Integration is essentially a facade for Spring Integration. The DSL provides a simple way to embed Spring Integration Message Flows into your application using the fluent Builder pattern together with existing Java and Annotation configurations from Spring Framework and Spring Integration as well. Another useful tool to simplify configuration is Java 8 Lambdas.

Developers joining this webinar will learn the DSL basics and see it in action.
