A Message from Greg Stroud
JANUARY 2015 SALES NEWS FLASH
Global Field Operations Team,

Please take the time to read our final communication for the year carefully; as there are a number of updates that you should be aware of.

2015 Compensation Update

Pivotal’s Field Compensation Overviews will be taking place via WebEx by Geo January 26 (Managers) and January 27th. These sessions will be recorded and slides along with an FAQ will be posted shortly after to the Field Operations page on Inside Pivotal. The session will also cover Territory coverage, Bookings policy and an introduction to our new Commissions Tool, where you will be directed to sign your Goal Acknowledgement Forms (GAFs). If you are missing the session on your calendar, please contact Dzavala@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:dzavala@pivotal.io&gt;. 

Compensation Tool Updates

Callidus, Pivotal’s Sales Performance Management tool will be your destination to sign your GAFs, view your compensation statements, attainment and order detail reports. It is also where you will submit questions/requests directly to the Sales Finance Compensation team. The tool is integrated with SFDC and will go live in February. Everyone that has a commission’s component to their compensation plans will have access. Please visit the Global Operations Inside Pivotal page for additional information on the tool. 

People Source is another new tool that was launched at the beginning of January. The tool includes an employee directory, organizational chart, profile (both public and private), FBP (Field Bonus Plan) goal writing and FBP (Field Bonus Plan) bonus payout tools. This system is authenticated through Okta, and not behind the EMC firewall, enabling easier accessibility to your employee information. As a result, we expect People Source to better manage collaboration on your goals and easier administration of the FBP payout process. To learn more about these new tools, please attend one of the following training sessions. 

Employee People Source Trainings (FBP) Dates/Times:


 - January 21, 2015: 8:00 - 9:00 AM PST
 - January 21, 2015: 12:00 - 1:00 PM PST
 - January 21, 2015:  6:00 - 7:00 PM PST

 Product Update - What&apos;s 
New

 Update on Chorus from Alpine Data Labs

Alpine Chorus became a product on controlled availability in anticipation of a change to our OEM agreement with Alpine Data Labs. Effective immediately, Pivotal will no longer resell Alpine Data Labs products, including Alpine Chorus. Alpine offerings have been removed from the Pivotal price lists and Configurator and will no longer be commissionable. 

Pivotal has and will continue to strongly recommend and tightly integrate with Alpine Data Labs’ products. For more information about how to handle prospective Alpine Chorus customers, as well as renewals, upgrades, and support questions for existing Alpine Chorus customers, please refer to this FAQ &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/document/d/1R278p4Wngla14VwjItCUSLF7hERUyICBEKkgZMPl9fQ/edit&gt;. Please direct any additional questions to data-prod-marketing@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:data-prod-marketing@pivotal.io&gt;.

The DCA Is Now Two SKUs

As we explained in our November 2014 newsletter, as of January 1st 2015, no single SKU DCA solutions should be quoted moving forward.  All net-new DCA sales will have to follow the new dual SKU (Hardware + Software) pricing approach and you will be required to sell the Big Data Suite along with the DCA HW SKUs. Expansions and upgrades of existing DCA customers will be handled on a case by case basis, with a bias toward attaching Big Data Suite moving forward.

 Please refer to this FAQ &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/document/d/1rddgu48c1TrsAqMTCwVNHsdApbciNv45lnG8Ilkhv6Q/edit?pli=1&gt; for more details, or should you have additional questions, please contact data-prod-marketing@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:data-prod-marketing@pivotal.io&gt;.


Make it happen!
