    <textOnly>Dear Colleagues,

Scott Aronson has decided that he will be leaving Pivotal after the close of the quarter in order to have time for his new family and then to consider and prepare for the next step in his career.

Scott has given 
amazing service to the Federation at both VMware and Pivotal. He was one of the very early members of the field team at VMware, starting there in late 2002 and helped grow revenues from almost nothing to several billion dollars. He was instrumental in managing many facets of the business from global accounts to channels and alliances.  At my request, he then became part of the original team at Pivotal. He has played an integral role on our journey to form and transform the company, focused around Labs, PCF, and BDS --all in a subscription model.  He has helped us grow a disciplined and well-managed field capability focused in the enterprise segment.

His dedication and his sense of humor will be missed. I would like to ask all of you to join me in thanking Scott for what he has done for us and to wish him well in his future endeavors.

Scott and the field team, along with the company at large, will be working away between now and quarter close in what we hope will be a 
great finish to Q2 and the first half of 2015.  We will not be immediately replacing Scott, and the three geo sales leads (Andy Oâ€™Brien, Melissa Ries, Alan Coad) will report to Bill Cook.</textOnly>
