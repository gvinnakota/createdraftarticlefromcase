    <subject>A Message From Paul and Rob</subject>
    <textOnly>Two-years ago, Pivotal was deliberately created to be a “special company”. A company built on an indelible culture, based on a common set of values and beliefs called the “Pivotal Principles”—Do What Works, Do What’s Right, Be 
Kind. Great companies are built by great cultures. It’s not product or services that bind a company together. Nor is it the size of its workforce or strength of its balance sheet make a company strong. It has and will always be about culture. Our culture is what attracts the world’s most talented people to our company. In turn, these talents collaborate to engineer elegant solutions to complex problems. The Pivotal culture is what makes us special. It’s what makes the world’s most admired brands clamor to want to work with us. Protect it at all cost. 

 
Over the past 35 years, I have been fortunate enough to surround myself with some of the most dynamic, innovative and creative people in the world. People who have made a lasting imprint on the world and who share my fundamental belief that we can use technology to solve even the most complex problems—Rob Mee is one of those people.

 
We just celebrated one of the best quarters financially in the history of our company. I have never felt more optimistic and confident about our future. Those are the best circumstances under which to make this sort of change. Pivotal is ready, and so is Rob Mee. As the Founder and CEO of Pivotal Labs, Rob has been credited for shaping the software development cultures of some of Silicon Valley’s most influential and valuable brands—Google, Facebook, Twitter, eBay, etc. He&apos;s an exceptional leader and technologist, passionate about our mission, committed to our principles and values, and knows how to build a successful business.

 
My experience at Pivotal has been one of the most important and rewarding experiences of my career. I will remain actively engaged in the company as Executive Chairman, helping to serve both as an evangelist and to provide strategic guidance.

First I was an engineer. Then a founder. Now a CEO. But I’m still an engineer with a founder’s mentality. We created Pivotal to transform how the world builds software. That mission and aspiration continues to drive our success today and influences everything we do. As Paul said, we are a special company, defined by our special culture. While others in Silicon Valley chase individual accolades and hacker stereotypes, Pivotal’s culture dictates that together we can make the once impossible probable. We do it by being kind to one another. Giving more than we expect to receive. Standing up and sharing, everyday. In sum, for us, software is a team sport. 



When I first met Paul, I knew him only by his iconic reputation as former EVP at Microsoft during Bill Gates’ tenure, and as CEO of VMware. As I got to know Paul, his character and values-driven approach to leadership stood out, and something special happened. Paul stated many times that he felt strongly about preserving the Pivotal name when Pivotal as we now know it was formed a little over two years ago. And while Pivotal goes far beyond the original scope of Pivotal Labs, with our Pivotal Cloud Foundry platform and Pivotal Big Data Suite products, the mission remains the same—to transform how the world builds software. 


Entire industries, from automotive to financial services to retail, are being disrupted by software, and more than ever they need our help to both remain relevant and innovate in a world shaped by software. All of us have the opportunity to show our customers a new way of doing things. Invite them to join our software movement. When we do that, we can fundamentally alter the future of companies large and small—helping them not just to survive, but thrive. 


It&apos;s a mission that inspired the creation of Pivotal Labs in 1989, and Pivotal in 2012. Over the years, I&apos;ve watched many of you adopt this mission and make it your own. I&apos;m excited to see how that shapes the technologies you create and the companies you transform.
