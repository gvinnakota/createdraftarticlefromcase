Hadoop has emerged as “a” if not “the” viable storage layer for hundreds of petabytes of data at scale. Transactional applications, which are dealing with ever increasing volumes of data, need low latency, high throughput in-memory data stores that can present a global view of data in real-time. 
 
Pivotal GemFire XD brings proven enterprise class in-memory data processing with Pivotal HD 1.1, creating a unique data platform for high-speed data ingest and real-time event processing on Hadoop at cloud scale. 
 Register now &lt;http://play.gopivotal.com/Real-timeDataServiceswithHadoop_Register.html&gt; and learn how to: 

 - Scale HDFS with policy driven in-memory data retention
 - Query online and offline data in HDFS
 - Conduct ETL-less bi-directional integration with other Pivotal HD Services.


We hope you&apos;ll be able to join us, 

The Pivotal Team
