    <subject>Termination of Support of Pivotal VRP software</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Valued Customer:

 Pivotal continues to provide leading edge technology in products that provide enterprise wide solution to our customersâ€™ information technology needs. As enterprise technology and customer requirements have evolved, so too are Pivotal products. In some cases we are divesting ourselves of specific technical assets, and in other cases we are expanding our investment in specific technology. These changes are about leverage and improving efficiency for our customers. 

Pivotal provides you with notification that Pivotal VRP software support will terminate on March 31, 2016 so that we can concentrate our efforts on current technology. On January 2015 we will be transitioning VRP software support from EMC On Line Support to Pivotal Support. To continue receiving support of Pivotal VRP software, please register with Pivotal Support &lt;https://support.pivotal.io/hc/en-us&gt;.

Contract Related Notices

Termination of Support for Pivotal VRP software is effective March 31, 2016.Your then-current EMC maintenance contract for Greenplum Database Software or your Greenplum Data Computing Appliance system will continue to apply to in the manner provided in the EMC maintenance contract.
