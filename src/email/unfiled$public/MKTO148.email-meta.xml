    <subject>Important Product Announcements from Scott Aronson</subject>
    <textOnly>Team - 

This week, three big announcements will help demonstrate Pivotal&apos;s leadership. 
The first highlights our success in APJ with the inaugural Asia Pacific Pivotal Summit and the opening of The Pivotal Innovation Centre in Singapore. As the first lab of its kind in Asia, this unique space will be a collaborative testing ground for customers, providing Pivotal resources dedicated to developing advanced proof of concepts and prototypes across all industries. Please join me in congratulating the APJ team. Both The Centre and The Summit will be a launching pad for growth in APJ.

 On October 23rd, Pivotal will announce two significant additions to the Data Fabric portfolio. These products represent our continued innovation and commitment to helping enterprise customers maximize value from Big Data, on Hadoop and beyond. 
Below you&apos;ll find links that will point you to related training materials and FAQ sheets to help prepare for customer conversations.
