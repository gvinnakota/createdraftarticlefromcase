 Vol. 2, No. 4

Make it Happen

 I spend most days focused on goals, objectives, action items and execution. Last week, at our Worldwide Sales Kickoff event (WWSKO) &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/sales-kick-off-2014&gt;, was no exception. The company’s goals and objectives were made crystal clear: the company target is $322.5M, we all need to rally around Pivotal One, the two main sales plays are our Big Data Suite and PaaS/Pivotal CF and we need to take advantage of our strategic services. Scott Aronson and the rest of the Leadership Team asked all of us to Make it Happen!

Of course, we’ll need help to do that. In this edition of the biweekly Pivotal Newsletter, we’ll get a business update from Nick Cayou’s Alliances and Field Product Group, understand who TechOps partners with to get things done for Products, and learn about outreach success in Analyst Relations and Corporate 
Communications.

 I met a lot of cool folks last week at WWSKO. For example, Lee Loughnane from Nick Cayou’s team is responsible for delivering joint solutions that create strategic value and accelerate revenue for Pivotal, VMware, VCE and Cisco. Lee also partners with one of our internal GTM Teams (see the “Hello my name is…” section) to align product and company strategy with alliance strategy. Lee gets it…and so does his nine-year-old daughter, Lily. :-)

BUSINESS UPDATE
Nick Cayou
 Sr. Director, Alliances and Field Product Group

Making it Happen in the Alliances and Field Product Group

 The Alliances and Field Product Group has two missions. The first is to expand Pivotal’s ecosystem of partners who can position, sell and deliver services around the Pivotal One portfolio at a global scale. The second is to ensure that the field organization has the best resources, representation and messaging available to drive success in the market around Pivotal’s key sales motions in 2014: Big Data Suite, PaaS and EVP (EMC, VMware, Pivotal) Solutions.

 In 2014, the Alliances 
team will focus EMC, VMware and RSA – our federation partners. This team will also help craft and deliver our EVP solutions. Additionally, we’ll focus on developing Capgemini, Accenture and Atos as global systems integration (SI) delivery partners – all of which are in various stages of building out Pivotal practices. In addition to global SIs, the Alliances team is managing our relationships with SAS, Cisco, VCE and a number of OEM partners who embed and resell our technology as part of larger, integrated offerings.

 Equally busy in in 2014, the Field Product Group will be working closely with 
Field Engineering, Product Marketing and Product Management teams under the construct of a Go-To-Market (GTM) Team, providing the “voice of the field” and ensuring that our data science and vertical field sales resources are supporting our key, must-win deals globally and helping guide 
our strategy.

 The Alliances team has done a stellar job in 2013 – securing large commitments from Capgemini, Accenture, Atos and others – to build practices around our Data and PaaS offerings. In addition, Cisco and VCE recently certified Pivotal HD and Pivotal CF on Cisco’s UCS servers and Vblock, respectively. The Field Product Group was key to our nearly 100% year-on-year Hadoop growth last year and will help us drive Pivotal CF growth on the same trajectory in 2014.

Making it Happen in TechOps

 TechOps was busy last year – facilitating and aligning a multitude of projects with engineering requirements. This year began hectically, as we wrapped up Keynote (our longest serving Datacenter/Lab facility). Lots of history, tons of gear and numerous applications used to run in the facility.

 Here are some highlights of what we accomplished (in Q4 2013 and the beginning of Q1 2014) while also fulfilling daily engineering needs.

Keynote Move 


 - Savings of ~$500K/year
 - 30 racks of gear redistributed to Hopkinton, MA, Durham, NC and Palo Alto, CA
 - ~ 90 critical build/release, QA applications and resources were migrated to Durham
 - Decommissioned four pallets of hardware older than five years


Single Sign-On  


 - All key engineering tools and applications (Confluence, JIRA, Stash/GIT, Fisheye, TestRail, etc.) now use Single Sign-On
 - Increased new-hire and developer productivity


GIT Migration 


 - 20+ Major products are now on internal GIT infrastructure. e.g. PHD, HAWQ, GPDB, MADLIB, etc.
 - Thanks to the release engineering team for the migration efforts


Increased GPCloud usage by 100% 


 - 15+ products use GPCloud for various functions
 - 260+ engineers using ~1000 VMs with minimal hardware footprint


Increased Rapid Deploy Clusters While Reducing Inventory from $8.1M to $7.3M 


 - Clusters of different capacities (18 nodes, 36 nodes, 48 nodes) along with maintenance of 200-node SFO cluster
 - Helped engineering teams improve various aspects of our products


We partner with EMC’s datacenter folks in Durham, NC for on-site support and they provide services for larger projects. We also partner with EMC IT for seamless network connectivity to the infrastructure in Durham from Palo Alto. We started this year with a successful datacenter migration and are looking forward to continuing that momentum throughout 2014!

 Analyst Relations

Making it Happen in Analyst Relations

 Pivotal’s ambitious mission to deliver a New Platform for a New Era is a compelling one. Industry analysts, who have been watching Pivotal intensely since our inception, have (at times) struggled to understand what we’re all about. Especially, since they generally approach the world from the silos they’ve created over the years. In Analyst Relations, we tear down these silos and help create new frameworks of understanding.

 In addition to writing reports and opinion pieces, industry analysts speak to our customers and prospects on a regular basis. Providing analysts with the most up-to-date information ensures that they understand Pivotal’s solutions and direction, and helps them to better advise their clients.

 I’m responsible for “influencing” the industry analysts (Gartner, Forrester, etc.) that cover 
our space. In their world, the needle moves slowly. So, consistently providing them with real-life proof points is key. Additionally, I work with analysst firms to produce assets for the field – such as the recent ROI study on Pivotal Data Dispatch &lt;http://gopivotal.com/sites/default/files/n188-%20Pivotal%20Data%20Dispatch%20ROI%20Case%20Study%20-NYSE%20EURONEXT_0.pdf&gt;. To understand what analysts think about Pivotal and the overall market, I post relevant reports on the Analyst Relations Site &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/analyst-relations/home&gt;. If you ever get wind of an analyst in your account, or are concerned what they may say about us, please don’t hesitate to contact me at aorenstein@gopivotal.com &lt;mailto:aorenstein@gopivotal.com&gt;. Or, come by and see me in person at the San Francisco office.

HELLO, MY NAME IS…
Jont Kingsepp
 Global EVP Solutions,
 Alliances and Field Product Group

At Pivotal, I…
 spend each day working with people across all areas of the organization. I’m always impressed by the caliber of our team and the passion they have for our products.

You can find me…
 either in the San Francisco Bay Area (going from meeting to meeting) or with our customers and partners in the field.

Currently, I’m working on…
 a new program at EMC called “EVP Solutions” and leading our internal “EVP” GTM Team. These solutions are designed to solve customer problems by applying technology and services from EMC (“E”), VMware (“V”) and Pivotal (“P”). Pivotal plays a featured role in each of the first three EVP Solutions – Data Lake, Security and Software Defined Data Center (SDDC).

In my spare time…
 I spend as much time with my wife and kids as possible – attending their sporting events, 
playing games or just hanging out – the weekends always fly by! 

Something you probably don’t know about me…
 I’m an avid hockey player and golfer – and I have two hole-in-ones (despite a 20 handicap). 

To me, Pivotal…
 is positioned for success – great technology, great vision, great leaders, great people and great market opportunity.
