Apple didn’t invent the first touchscreen phone &lt;http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/evolution-of-mobile-phones/&gt;. They just made an astounding iterative leap. 

 The first thing I saw that looked and functioned like one (more or less) was a Dopod. Produced by a Taiwanese manufacturer, it had a touch screen, a single button at the base...and was ½-inch thick. I was in a cab in Shanghai on the way to work in the spring of 2004 when I took out my Dopod, pressed the button, tilted the screen for landscape view, and surfed the Internet. It was slow (no Wi-Fi) and had zero apps. But it was ambitious and very cool. 

 Mobility was one of the megaforces that changed China forever. And today, of course, people manage large chunks of their lives from phones. I’m very pleased to announce that, starting with this issue, the newsletter is mobile-friendly. So you can read it on your phone! 

 And enjoy the updates, because Pivotal is roaring into Q3!
BUSINESS UPDATE 
 Hitting Our Stride
Amar Varma &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/974185-amarvarma&gt;, Amar Varma, GM Mobile
As GM of Mobile, I am currently working with the Pivotal Labs Sales team in our aggressive push to Enterprise customers while ensuring the team meet its targets. For the first half of 2014, I am pleased to announce that the team is ahead of plan and looks to continue with momentum into the second half of 2014. 

 Some of the new customers we have gained this year include ABC, Bank of Montreal, Barnes &amp; Noble, MLB, NBCUniversal, Nordstrom, UEFA and Under Armour. These are indicative of the types of organizations that can benefit from the Pivotal offering as a whole over time, so kudos goes out to the entire team for getting these customers in the door! 

 In recent months, I’ve observed all aspects of the business really hitting their 
stride. The various sales groups from Pivotal Corporate, Pivotal Labs and EMC have aligned themselves closely – working together to identify enterprise customers ripe for the transformation to Agile, which is our unique offering. The process also works in reverse; because Pivotal Labs represents “the tip of the spear” of Pivotal’s service offering, we have fewer barriers to entry with customers. Once they’re familiar with our process and recognize our ability to deliver, it opens the door to introduce them to the rest of the Pivotal stack. 

 Agile truly is redefining the enterprise and how it operates – I’ve witnessed this firsthand with our own customers. At the recent Montreal CIO Summit, an EMC Federation-led event that hosts Global and Enterprise CIOs, I had an opportunity to share our customers’ experiences with the audience. In my discussions, I was pleased to learn that most of the event’s attendees were already embracing Agile or have it as a to-do in 2014! 

 I look forward to working with all of you as we continue this exciting journey together!

Make It Happen: Woldwide Sales Kickoff 2014 

What an exciting Q2 for Pivotal Big Data! Pivotal Big Data Suite &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/big-data/pivotal-big-data-suite&gt; made a grand entrance as an official SKU (thank you Sales Ops!), with the Field quickly closing amazing multi-million dollar deals. Many of you started seeding these opportunities with our teams back in February at the Worldwide Sales Kickoff &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/sales-kick-off-2014&gt;. It’s been outstanding to work with this Field organization. Thank you all! 

 Q3 looks to be just as exciting. We have a very healthy pipeline that we’re here to help the Field close. In Product Marketing, we’ve been working to arm you all with the tools, training and awareness that you need. We’re increasingly focused on the two key sales plays – Business Data Lakes, and Big Data Analytics and Apps – with great success. Pivotal Big Data Suite powers both of these motions and has differentiated itself through its breadth of capabilities, cost and flexibility. The customers have voted with their budgets for us. 

 We’re also communicating across functions in a more effective way. The Data Marketing team now consolidates quarterly updates into a single report, with headline news and links to resources. Please take a few moments to catch up on the arsenal we’re building to support you &lt; https://drive.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/folderview?id=0B7BNFmQ6k07_LWRrV2c0SHdrZ0U&amp;usp=sharing&gt;. It includes new assets and tools covering in-memory and MPP analytics, Hadoop and SQL on Hadoop, journey marketing, use-case marketing and technical marketing. 

 I couldn’t be more energized for the second half of 2014. We’ll be digging into your QBRs and we’ll continue to help power this momentum. Happy selling everyone and congrats on Q2!

Alabaster gleam: Pivotal Labs’ new Chicago office in the Merchandise Mart Plaza 

 Greetings from the newest Pivotal Labs office in the Windy City! Situated along the picturesque Chicago River in the historic Merchandise Mart Plaza, we’re settling in nicely to our new digs. 

 Our presence here represents a lot of opportunity for Pivotal. Illinois serves as the headquarters or hosts of United Airlines, McDonald’s and Walgreens. We’ve also already worked with some really interesting clients, such as Instructure &lt;http://www.instructure.com/&gt;, Pearson &lt;http://www.pearson.com/&gt; and SendGrid &lt;http://sendgrid.com/&gt;. 

 We recently launched the Android &lt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cellit.flexilist.leye&gt; and iOS &lt;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lettuceeats/id351174022?mt=8&gt; apps for Lettuce Eats &lt;http://www.leye.com/app&gt;, the restaurant division of Lettuce Entertain You. This was our first mobile project at the new office, and a challenging and fun engagement. They’re a big name in Chicago. 

 With a staff of six, we’re actively looking for new Pivots &lt;http://pivotallabs.com/careers/&gt; to fill roles across all disciplines. If you know a qualified candidate in the Chicago area, please send their name to mbarinek@pivotallabs.com &lt;mailto:mbarinek@pivotallabs.com&gt; and/or recruiting@pivotallabs.com &lt;mailto:recruiting@pivotallabs.com&gt;. 

 We’re off to a great start, and we’ll keep you posted!

MY NAME IS... 
 Kristin Smaby &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1033811-kristinsmaby&gt;
 Customer Service Manager
Manage the Customer Service team in Palo Alto, CA.
In the Palo Alto office. On the left side of the first floor at the standing desks (by the new water station)!
Helping Pivotal build a stellar customer service brand as a differentiator. Our mission statement: remarkable customer service through straightforward policies and streamlined workflows. It may not be sexy, but it’s what we need.
Doing yoga. Join us on Mondays and Thursdays at 5pm for Yoga at Pivotal in Palo Alto!
While I’m passionate about customer service, my first love is math. In fact, I majored in Math and Computer Science at college. I assumed I would be a software engineer but my plan changed when I entered the workforce. I realized what made me jump out of bed every morning was the idea that I got to solve customer problems and make them smile. Ever since, my mission has been to change how companies value customer service. 

 I even wrote about customer service in article entitled “Being Human is Good Business &lt;http://bit.ly/VMkgau&gt;”. You can read it here &lt;http://bit.ly/VMkgau&gt;.
Has to be the best job of my career thus far. I love the people and look forward to coming to work every day!
