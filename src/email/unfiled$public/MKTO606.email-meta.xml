    <subject>Product Advisory: GPCC 1.2.2.0</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

GPCC 1.2.2.0 has a bug where users that are not &quot;gpadmin&quot; or &quot;gpmon&quot; cannot login to the GPCC UI/website. As this is fundamental functionality, the product was removed from download sites. 


We are expecting the GPCC 1.2.2.1 version with the fix to be available in the week of May 12, 2014.

Thank you,
The Pivotal Team</textOnly>
