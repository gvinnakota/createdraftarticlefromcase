    <subject>Big Q2 Wins and New Sales Assets</subject>
    <textOnly>Team,

Congrats to everyone on what was another hugely successful quarter for Pivotal. We had some great deals this quarter including wins like State Farm, Comcast, and Charles Schwab. Many of the deals are impressive in their size and also because they show a broad acceptance of our innovative offerings.

Customers are validating Pivotal&apos;s unique combination of software and expertise, embracing us as a key strategic partner as they evolve and grow in their 
software strategies.

We have added new assets &lt;http://info.pivotal.io/L9o2JU0080160IYdD0N0C0A&gt; this quarter that analyze top Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Pivotal Big Data Suite, and Pivotal Labs wins. As always you can find anonymized, scripted business case slides that you can use to share these stories, and detailed wins analysis. In addition, we make available the actual interviews with the reps who have won these deals. These are easily downloadable in .mp4 format, for your use on the road.

Please continue to tune in to the @RingTheBell channel &lt;http://info.pivotal.io/m000AZ20o09C8NDdU620IJ0&gt; on Socialcast, to get the scoop on 
significant deals as they happen.

If you have questions or comments on any of the above, please let Estelle Hayes know.</textOnly>
