Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

We would like to invite you to our event Addressing the ‘Where to Start’ with Big Data, a joint event between Pivotal and Triangle on Thursday, September 19, 2013.

Big Data and Data Analytics are now considered seriously by most companies to help differentiate themselves from their competitors. Many companies have some form of BI but are lacking the depth and speed of information to help fine-tune their business and predictive capabilities. Adapting organizations to the use of Big Data involves people, processes and technology. This event will provide you with the insight into adopting these new technologies and is shown from a Data Scientist’s perspective. Register Now &lt;http://www.triangle.ie/events&gt;.

Event Details

During this event we’ll review real business cases to show the application of Pivotal technologies our own data scientists.

The event will feature interactive exercises to help you draft a Big Data roadmap for your organization, covering how you can tackle implementation of a big data solution and the positive impact it can have on your business.

Please let us know if you would like to attend by registering now &lt;http://www.triangle.ie/events&gt;. We look forward to seeing you on the 19th September at 09.30.

 

Yours Sincerely,

The Pivotal Team
