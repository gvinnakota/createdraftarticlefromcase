    <subject>Update â€“ Pivotal Data Dispatch</subject>
    <textOnly>Team - 

I would like to update you on the latest status of our Pivotal Data Dispatch product. As some of you know, the New York Stock 
Exchange (NYSE) was purchased by the InterContinental Exchange (ICE). ICE has made the decision to focus on their core businesses and has decided to disinvest in further development of PDD. Pivotal and ICE are currently working to find a long-term home for the PDD product. 

 The business value PDD brings to the workflow of a data lake still applies and we plan on reselling PDD if at all possible. In this interim period while the future of PDD is ironed out, we would like you to stop actively introducing the product into your accounts. We do not want you to quote nor sell PDD until this is resolved. 

 If you have already introduced PDD in your sales cycles, please work with Jim Totte in business development and Oak Barrett in product management to work out the appropriate course of action. 

 Lets continue to make it happen.
