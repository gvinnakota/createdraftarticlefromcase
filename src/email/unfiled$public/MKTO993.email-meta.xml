    <textOnly>Team,

Our 2015 Worldwide Sales Kick-off (WWSKO) is coming into focus. We will host this year’s event in San Francisco in February to fully leverage our Bay Area base, so please mark your calendars now.

The dates and high-level agenda are: 
 


 - Tuesday 17, February - Arrivals | Evening Welcome Reception
 - Wednesday, 18 February - AM General Session | PM Breakouts | Off-Site Dinner
 - Thursday, 19 February - AM General Session | All-Day Breakouts | Evening Awards Ceremony
 - Friday, 20 February - AM Departures


While we have a lot of planning ahead of us, like last year, the Worldwide Sales Kick-off will bring together our leadership and teams to set the tone for executing on every aspect of our business in 2015. With momentum surging around Pivotal CF, the Big Data Suite, Pivotal Labs, and the associated synergies - I can’t stress enough the value of this gathering.

WWSKO will be a defining moment for us all as we kick things into gear for 2015!

Make it happen!</textOnly>
