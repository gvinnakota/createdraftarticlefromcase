EMC World is the place where the full range of EMC Communities come together. Connect with us at one of our keynotes, presentations or in the exhibit hall. We will be showcasing our solutions at the intersection of cloud, big data and agile development, powering enterprise transformation in booth #349. Come see our CEO, Paul Maritz speak on Enterprise Cloud and PaaS at his keynote on Tuesday, May 5th at 10:00 AM.

Enterprise Hybrid Cloud is the path to enterprise IT transformation, enabling organizations to run workloads smoothly and securely in private clouds, in managed private clouds hosted by service providers and in public clouds.

PIVOTAL DATA ROADSHOW: A VIEW FROM THE ROAD
&lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/big-data-pivotal/products/pivotal-data-roadshow-a-view-from-the-road&gt;
The response to the Pivotal Data Roadshow, held in a number of cities across North America this month, has been quite impressive. It clearly demonstrates the customer and market demand for hands-on experience and training with big data technologies. Our initial events have been over capacity, with packed houses numbering nearly 100 attendees in each city. The response represents the massive progress within the open source Apache Hadoop ecosystem in recent years, and the degree to which Hadoop has been embraced within the enterprise to handle big data storage and analytics workloads.

MAXIMIZING CLOUD OPTIONALITY
&lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/cloud-foundry-pivotal/products/maximizing-cloud-optionality&gt;
Pivotal&apos;s Coté reviews the big impact the small licensing changes we made last week had for Pivotal Cloud Foundry customers, allowing them to move between private clouds and Pivotal Web Services without incurring extra costs. Equally importantly, Pivotal Cloud Foundry customers now have all types of cloud at their disposal, helping them get the multi-cloud capabilities: they can run in full-on, public cloud multi-tenant mode, single-tenant “public cloud” in an AWS VPC, or “private cloud” on their own hardware. These changes allow customers a greater range of optionality for their infrastructure development and deployment choices, and speeding the time to deliver apps.
