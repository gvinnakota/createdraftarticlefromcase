    <subject>Spring Webinars: Introducing Java DSL for Spring Integration, Documenting RESTful APIs, Spring XD and Introducing Spring Session</subject>
    <textOnly>Introducing the Java DSL for Spring Integration
Speaker: Gary Russell
 
 The Spring Integration JavaConfig and DSL extension provides a set of convenient Builders and a fluent API to configure Spring Integration message flows from Spring @Configuration classes. The Java DSL for Spring Integration is essentially a facade for Spring Integration. The DSL provides a simple way to embed Spring Integration Message Flows into your application using the fluent Builder pattern together with existing Java and Annotation configurations from Spring Framework and Spring Integration as well. Another useful tool to simplify configuration is Java 8 Lambdas.

Developers joining this webinar will learn the DSL basics and see it in action.

Documenting RESTful APIs
Speaker: Andy Wilkinson

An API&apos;s documentation is a vital part of making it easy to understand and easy to use. RESTful APIs are no different. In this webinar we&apos;ll look at what should be included in your RESTful API&apos;s documentation and, just as importantly, what should be omitted. To illustrate this we&apos;ll look at some real-world examples of good and bad API documentation. 

We&apos;ll look at some of the problems and limitations of choosing a tool like Swagger to produce your API&apos;s documentation and conclude by looking at some alternatives that are better-suited to producing documentation that your users will love.

Spring XD: A Platform for data at scale and developer productivity
Speaker: Sabby Anandan

Worried about Big Data and the challenges inherent in making a real application? You donâ€™t have to worry anymore! Spring XD provides a one-stop shop solution that spans traditional enterprise to Big Data use cases - both batch and streaming. It&apos;s important to choose the right tool for each use-case, which is why Spring XD integrates with technologies such as Spark, Reactor and RxJava to demonstrate the flexibility and the unified programming model to support complex data computation use-cases.

In this webinar, we&apos;ll show you how to develop data-driven use cases much faster than other big data solutions on the out of the box XD runtime.

Introducing Spring Session
Speaker: Josh Long

Back in the era of the application server, HTTP Session replication was a common way to scale out user session data, as well as make it fault tolerant. In today&apos;s world of lightweight containers, PaaS, and virtualization, Spring Session offers a 100% server and/or container portable HTTP Session.

See how Spring Session easily plugs in implementations like Redis, scales out across a cluster, handles multiple users&apos; browser sessions, works with WebSocket, and allows header based authentication within REST apps. It&apos;s a perfect fit for working with user data, particularly in a highly distributed environment like the cloud, or on a Platform like Cloud Foundry.
