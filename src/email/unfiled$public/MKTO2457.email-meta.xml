    <subject>Learn about Spring Cloud, Microservices and Cloud Foundry at CF Summit</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;http://www.cfsummit.com&gt;
Ok, so this is not just a list of cool Spring Cloud, Spring Boot, Devops, and Buildpack related sessions at Cloud Foundry Summit, it includes aspirational talks/keynotes from speakers, authors, leaders, and just plain old old-of-the-box 
thinkers that we believe you&apos;ll want to hear from and appreciate. If you or your team is curious about 12-factor applications, microservices and want the benefits of the JVM, then check out the show and register now &lt;http://www.cfsummit.com&gt;! 


 Tuesday, May 12 â€¢ 1:30pm - 2:00pm  
Deploying Microservice Architectures with Cloud 
Foundry 
 Speaker: Matt Stine &lt;http://cfsummit2015.sched.org/speaker/mattstine#.VS6rev1DXRo&gt;, Pivotal 

 Now that you have Cloud Foundry, what are you going to do with it? This presentation will show using Spring Cloud 
on Cloud Foundry to quickly leverage common microservice patterns, including distributed configuration management, service discovery, intelligent routing, load balancing, and fault tolerance. Using Spring Cloud on Cloud Foundry, developers can take advantage of the cloud native microservice architectures pioneered by those building the web at places like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Netflix. In many cases they can do so running the same code with Spring Cloud wrapping the same battle-tested open source components those companies are running in production. 
 
This is just one of the many sessions that will address topics like the Cloud Foundry Java Buildpack experience, getting apps to production and deep dives for the devops-minded folks, 12 factor application concepts, and much more - including cool keynoters like Cory Doctorow, 
Andy Weir and others.
