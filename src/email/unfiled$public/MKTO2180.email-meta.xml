    <textOnly>Team,

As you know, CF Summit &lt;http://www.cfsummit.com&gt; is planned this year for May 11-12 in Santa Clara, CA. This will be an excellent opportunity for us to move Pivotal Cloud Foundry deals forward with talks from the Cloud Foundry ecosystem, and a stellar lineup of Pivotal CF customer speakers including Lockheed Martin, Verizon, Allstate Insurance, Humana, Kroger and more.

We have arranged a 25% discount off the $250 ticket price with the Cloud Foundry Foundation, using discount code CFS15CUS. I strongly encourage you to take advantage of this discount code with your inflight deals. In addition, for opportunities over $1Million, we have arranged for a limited number of sponsored free tickets. Please contact Kim-Marie Ruquet &lt;mailto:kruquet@pivotal.io&gt; to register your deals and obtain the sponsor code.

Looking forward to CF Summit setting us up nicely for a solid 2015. 

Be Bold,</textOnly>
