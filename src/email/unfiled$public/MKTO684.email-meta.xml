Fighting Fire with Fire: How Retailers Can Use Mobile to Combat Showrooming &lt;http://pivotallabs.com/fighting-fire-with-fire-how-brick-and-mortar-retailers-can-use-mobile-to-combat-showrooming/&gt;
 
If there were ever any doubts about the prevalence of showrooming in retail, the last year has silenced the critics once and for all. With upwards of 57% of post-showrooming purchases being made at Amazon.com, it is not surprising that the web-only store has been named ‘Retailer of the Year’ by the National Retail Federation.
 
&quot;Showrooming” - whereby a customer walks into a physical store, tries out a product, and then purchases that same product from an online retailer (usually at a cheaper price) - represents maximum value for the consumer, and maximum loss for a brick and mortar retailer.
 
So what can you do to combat showrooming? We recommend the following tactics:


 - Offer in-aisle store comparisons
 - Entice people to buy on the spot
 - Offer superior customer service


Learn how you can take advantage of mobile to combat showrooming by reading the full post on our blog &lt;http://pivotallabs.com/fighting-fire-with-fire-how-brick-and-mortar-retailers-can-use-mobile-to-combat-showrooming/&gt;.</textOnly>
