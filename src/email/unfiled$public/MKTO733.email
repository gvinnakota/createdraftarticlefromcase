<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has agreed to buy the Los Angeles Clippers for a record-breaking $2 billion US. Now it's up to others whether the deal goes through. Shelly Sterling said in a statement issued late Thursday that she'd signed a binding contract for a sale of the Clippers by The Sterling Family Trust to Ballmer in what would be a record deal if approved by the NBA. Ballmer "will be a terrific owner," Sterling said, "We have worked for 33 years to build the Clippers into a premier NBA franchise. I am confident that Steve will take the team to new levels of success."</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Amazon is about to round out its Prime subscription service with a music streaming service, BuzzFeed reports. The service will stream old and new-ish music to Prime subs and will launch in June or July. The music service will likely be bundled with Amazon&rsquo;s Prime service that currently offers subscribers with free two-day shipping and access to a video streaming service and ebook lending library. However, the music service will leave Rdio and Spotify users wanting more. New releases will not be offered.BuzzFeed reports that the music catalog will offer a limited selection of songs and albums that are six months old or more. But that&rsquo;s how Amazon rolls.</span></p>
