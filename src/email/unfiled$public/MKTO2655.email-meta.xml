    <textOnly>Colleagues,

We had a great first half in 2015, and I’m proud that our field serves on front lines in taking and selling our unique proposition to more businesses everywhere.

Pivotal Club is our way to celebrate and reward your hard work and exceptional achievement in the field. I recently returned from this year’s Pivotal Club in Maui, Hawaii, spending time with our Club winners, and to help unveil the location of our 2016 Club location. 

I’m happy to announce that next year we’ll be renting out the entire St. Regis Bahia Beach Resort &lt;http://www.stregisbahiabeach.com/&gt; in Puerto Rico to celebrate our top achievers, in May of 2016. The St. Regis has something for everyone: A luxury retreat with a seaside pool, garden spa, golf course, plus a bar and three restaurants.

All of you should feel that you can achieve your goals this year to 
qualify for and attend Pivotal Club. Nothing is more rewarding than being recognized by your colleagues and the leadership team for the results of great work.  

Look for more communications in the near future on Pivotal Club 2016. We have more opportunities than ever to serve as the trusted business partner for our customers’ transformation.

I look forward to celebrating with you at Club, and as always, I and the 
executive leadership team are here to support you!</textOnly>
