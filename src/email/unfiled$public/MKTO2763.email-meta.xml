    <textOnly>Colleagues,

Thank you all who were able to join us at yesterday’s Town Hall, either live or online. 

If you couldn’t join us, please watch the video replay on Inside Pivotal Town Hall page &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/pivotal-town-hall&gt;. And please do take a few moments to complete the very brief Town Hall survey &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/forms/d/17M-wRGKO7taY5lRR9JMyVZOZ8L8P3W0z-MdC9oOYgvU/viewform&gt;. Your feedback is always welcome, and helps guide future events.  

 The version of the Pivotal Federation analyst deck that Paul Maritz presented yesterday can be found here on Inside 
Pivotal. Please follow the guidelines for its use. A number of slides contain more sensitive financial information not appropriate for general customer use or distribution. Please review the slides carefully before any further distribution. 
 
Thank you all again for your hard work, and for helping us on a journey that we are leading.</textOnly>
