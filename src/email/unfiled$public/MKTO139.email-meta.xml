    <textOnly>Modern Component Design with Spring
Speaker: Juergen Hoeller

In recent years, the Spring Framework focuses on flexible and powerful Java-based configuration. This talk presents Spring as an annotation-oriented application framework, illustrating the rich set of features that Spring has to offer for modern component design. 

General component model trends will be discussed along with selected Spring feature highlights, such as standardized annotations for dependency injection, stereotypes, and declarative services such as validation and scheduling.

Dynamic routing at 1 million per second with Spring Integration
Speakers: John Davies and Josh Long

While some of today&apos;s systems can hit Î¼Sec performance it usually take a lot of good design and optimisation. The solution is often hard-baked and inflexible and the end user still wants the flexibility promised by ESBs with dynamic routing based on runtime rules with transformations from one format to another. 

Josh and John will walk you through the latest in high performance message handling with Spring Integration covering non-XML (binary and CSV) data, code generation, on-the-fly compilation, dynamic routing and in-memory queries - an hour well spent.

Have You Seen Spring Lately?
Speaker: Josh Long

It&apos;s been an amazing year for Spring! 2013 saw the Spring family join Pivotal where - along with Cloud Foundry and our data driven technologies (the Pivotal HD Hadoop distribution, the GemFire data grid, and the RabbitMQ message broker) - Spring supports today&apos;s application workloads and profiles.

Today&apos;s Spring embraces Java 8, Scala, Groovy, provides a best-in-class REST stack, supports the open web, mobile applications, big-data applications and batch workloads. Today&apos;s Spring is easy to get started with, easy to learn, and embraces conventions over configuration. Today&apos;s Spring is part of the Spring.IO platform. Today&apos;s Spring is...Pivotal. 

Join Spring developer advocate Josh Long as he re-introduces you to today&apos;s Spring, a Spring you may not have seen yet.
