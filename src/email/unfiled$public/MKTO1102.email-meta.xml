EDITOR WELCOME
 Back In Season
 Steve Casale &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1033819-stephencasale&gt;, Sr. Manager, Corporate Communications
Summer makes its curtain call, and Pivotal takes the stage again. Things are different this time around. As one contributor reports in this issue, the energy coming from a highly successful VMware and Pivotal partnership at VMworld signals an important step for Pivotal.
 
 We may still be shaping a unique proposition, but we’re finding the upside and strength in our partnership with Federation parents EMC and VMware – as opposed to defining ourselves apart from them. Our leadership in the large and lively SpringOne developer community is also on display next week in Dallas (sneak peek below), and the Agile cast gives more proof that its methods are a spark for cultural change.
 
 Pivotal is back in season, and the show is better than ever. Enjoy!
BUSINESS UPDATE
 VMware and Pivotal – Stronger Together 
 Lee Loughnane &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/949149-leeloughnane&gt;, Director, Global Alliances, VMware
What a difference a year makes. In the wake of last week’s highly successful Pivotal showing at VMworld &lt;http://www.vmworld.com/index.jspa&gt; in San Francisco, it’s hard to recall that a little over a year ago Pivotal was focused on 
establishing what made it unique from its Federation &lt;http://emcfederation.com/&gt; parents.
 
 Pivotal spent much of 2014 tilling the potential of this key Federation partnership. The result is strong executive alignment with VMware, a roadmap and investment plan for joint solutions that build upon our shared Cloud Foundry heritage &lt;http://www.vmware.com/company/news/releases/vmw-newsfeed/VMware-Teams-With-Docker,-Google-and-Pivotal-to-Simplify-Enterprise-Adoption-of-Containers/1872989&gt;, and messaging alignment to market solutions and 
enable the field to finish strong in 2014 with momentum into 2015.
 
 Our mutual commitments through 2014 include the Focus Account Program, a Pivotal and VMware joint field engagement effort and selling motion for accounts with a high propensity for Pivotal CF on VMware IaaS &lt;http://www.vmware.com/company/news/releases/vmw-newsfeed/VMware-Unveils-New-vCloud-Air-Mobile-and-Hybrid-Cloud-Services/1872978&gt; – either as on-premise (vSphere) or hybrid deployments (vCloud Air) of Pivotal CF. Pivotal and VMware Americas field teams also have a target number for joint 2H wins and pipeline targets into 2015, with APJ and EMEA setting similar goals.
 
 Last week we saw early dividends when Pivotal marketing, pre-sales, sales, engineering and executive teams joined VMware to 
create a singular customer experience at VMworld. A record number of visitors (more than 2,300) attended the Pivotal booth presentations &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal/news-2/experience-no-limits-join-pivotal-at-vmware-vmworld-us-2014&gt;, while the joint Pivotal and VMware 
value proposition resonated throughout the demos, breakouts and keynotes. Capping it off were the over 200 customers and prospects who turned out for the Pivotal-hosted executive reception in San Francisco.

 We’re just getting started with VMware and you’ll be hearing a lot more 
about how we’re partnering to win!
PRODUCT UPDATE
 Pivotal Sets the Tone at SpringOne 2GX
 Andy Clement &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/916812-andyclement&gt;, Engineer, App Fabric R&amp;D
On September 8th Pivotal kicks off the SpringOne 2GX conference &lt;http://springone2gx.com/&gt;, where a thousand developers are expected to descend on Dallas, Texas to immerse themselves in the latest on Spring &lt;http://spring.io/&gt;, Groovy &lt;http://groovy.codehaus.org/&gt; and Grails &lt;https://grails.org/&gt;. Building on the Spring IO vision &lt;http://spring.io/platform&gt; we presented last year, Pivotal will showcase Spring IO enhancements around the key themes of micro-service architectures and Big Data.
 
 Micro-service architectures &lt;http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html&gt; are increasingly popular design approaches for developers to rapidly evolve application features, independently. They enable the continuous, iterative development that is the hallmark of Agile. The approach also brings coordination issues, when they call for the intelligent routing of requests, addressing service failures and more. Pivotal will announce Spring Cloud services – ready-to-go, customizable solutions that resolve a number of coordination issues around micro-services. We’ll also showcase a micro-service architecture running on our flagship platform, Pivotal CF.
 
 We’re delighted that Netflix &lt;http://netflix.github.io/#repo&gt; will join us onstage during the keynote 
to share how they employ Spring Boot on 50% of their new projects!
 
 On the topic of Big Data, attendees will hear more about the recent GA of Spring XD &lt;http://projects.spring.io/spring-xd/&gt;. Building on the strong foundations of Spring Batch &lt;http://projects.spring.io/spring-batch/&gt; and Spring 
Integration, Spring XD is a unified, distributed and extensible system for data ingestion, real-time analytics, batch processing and export. High-level DSL and out-of-the-box modules can help developers rapidly create Big Data solutions.
 
 We’ll feature Project Reactor &lt;https://github.com/reactor/reactor&gt;, a library for building reactive fast 
data applications on the Java virtual machine (JVM), which optimizes resource utilization on systems that employ new architectures. We’ll also present the first public demo of Grails 3.0 – custom-made for micro-services development.
 
 Pivotal has much in store for the 8-million strong Spring developer community!
AGILE UPDATE
 Agile Transformation and Teaching Change
 Michael Kahn &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/948737-michaelkahn&gt;, Director, Business Development, Pivotal Labs
When I first walked into the Pivotal Labs office in San Francisco, in May of 2013, I was struck by an atmosphere of innovation. It was palpable. In October of that same year, I too became part of this inspired company when Pivotal acquired Xtreme Labs &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/agile/pivotal-acquires-xtreme-labs&gt;.
 
 I’ve worked closely with clients 
over the past two years who are at various points on a journey to a new kind of software development. Some, like Uber &lt;http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/uber/b905a877-bd55-4ce7-a7aa-467cdc3a21f4&gt;, Facebook &lt;http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/messenger/3219d30d-4a23-4f58-a91c-c44b04e6a0c7&gt;, Fitbit &lt;http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/fitbit/378ebdb6-f31f-4505-a00d-c460ef22e7ff&gt;, SurveyMonkey &lt;https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/surveymonkey/id723867634?mt=8&gt; and Pearson – where software is the product – focus on great execution and an outstanding product.
 

 For others though, a move to Agile development is part of a cultural transformation. It’s exciting to work with larger, more established enterprises that fundamentally want to change. Clients such as Intel, Barnes &amp; Noble, and Nordstrom &lt;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nordstrom/id474349412?mt=8&gt; look at how we work and are inspired to use agile to cultivate a new workplace.
 
 Whether 
they’re ready to dip a toe in the water or dive right in, we’ve coached clients into making a transition to Agile: training and helping them hire people, teaching teams test-driven development, managing the agile process and velocity with Pivotal Tracker, or building a sustainable team 
via pair programming. These companies want a cultural and process transformation, to a workplace that is more transparent, productive, inspiring and fun.
 
 So what does that look like? Transformation can literally mean knocking down cubicles and walls. Below are before and after photos of one client, Nordstrom, and their Seattle offices.

 We’ve got great business cases on not just what we do, but how we do it. Look to this newsletter in the coming months for deep dives on Pivotal Labs use cases!

MY NAME IS...

 Phyllis Davidson &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1059010-phyllisdavidson&gt;, Sr. Director, Content Strategy
am the senior director of content strategy on the Pivotal corporate marketing team.
in both the San Francisco and Palo Alto offices. I split my time between the two. I’m enjoying commuting on the train (for the first time in my life) up to San Francisco, from the Peninsula, where I live in San Carlos.
My first project is working on updating the Pivotal corporate story. We want to make sure everyone clearly understands who we are and why they should do business with us! I’m also working on the customer journey, pivotal.io &lt;http://pivotal.io/&gt; content and the overall framework for Pivotal marketing content for both awareness and demand generation.
You can find me in one of three places: the gym, to which I am annoyingly addicted, according to my husband; with my 12-year old, likely trying to get her to do something she’s supposed to do but would rather not; or watching or reading science fiction. Thank goodness Dr. Who is back!

is a company ripe with opportunity. We’re at the flashpoint of what organizations need to do to compete and what technology can provide on that front. We’re the right partner for companies that will differentiate themselves through cloud-based applications – and that’s pretty much every business!
Welcome to Pivotal!
We’re happy you’re here! Please welcome the new employees who joined Pivotal from Month XXth to Month XXth:</textOnly>
