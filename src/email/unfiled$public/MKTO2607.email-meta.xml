    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

It was a pleasure having you at our Hadoop Summit dinner last night. We hope you enjoyed the opportunity to network, catch-up with friends, and talk about the ever-changing world of Big Data.

If you haven&apos;t already, come by our booth to see the latest Big Data Suite demos, HAWQ on Hortonworks using Ambari, or just to talk to our industry experts.
