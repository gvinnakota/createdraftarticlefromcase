We would like to welcome you to our new Singapore Spring User Group event!

In general, all information regarding our Spring User Group events can be found on singasug.com &lt;http://singasug.com&gt;. We have also created a Google Group here &lt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/singasug&gt;. You can register here &lt;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/singasug-event-cloud-night-on-march-6th-tickets-10736754923&gt;.

Deploying a Java application on a local Tomcat instance is easy. But you might not know that deploying to a remote server &quot;on the cloud&quot; can be nearly as easy.

Uli Hitzel (CloudFX) and Lawrence Crowther (Pivotal Australia) are 2 Cloud guys who will be discussing cloud platforms without all the fluff. Uli has a long story of working for open source in companies such as Redhat and Yahoo. He now works for CloudFX, a Singapore-based Consulting firm that helps their customers to migrate to Cloud platforms. Uli will be presenting about OpenStack and about Cloud Computing in 2014.

Lawrence Crowther has more than 12 years experience building and designing large enterprise systems across many different verticals both as a developer and solution architect. He designed one of the largest websites in Australia, www.news.com.au, which has over 50M page impressions per day. Lawrence will be presenting about Cloud Foundry, the &quot;Open PAAS&quot;.
