    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Thank you for joining us last week for our webinar &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/big-data/hadoop/querying-external-data-sources-with-hadoop-webinar&gt; &quot;Querying External Data Sources with Hadoop&quot; on July 15, 2014. 

We presented a demo on how to add extensibility into Hadoop and more:


 - How to eliminate the need to copy data from the underlying storage system to HDFS
 - How to leverage rich, deep and fast analytics on various Hadoop data files
 - How to conduct statistical and analytical functions from HAWQ to HBase or Hive data
 - How to run complex analytical queries that join in-database dimensional data with fact data stored in HBase
 - How to easily write your own custom PXF connectors to external data sources



We invite you to watch the replay &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/big-data/hadoop/querying-external-data-sources-with-hadoop-webinar&gt; to learn more about Pivotal HD &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/big-data/pivotal-hd&gt; and Pivotal Xtension Frameworks (PXF) &lt;http://blog.gopivotal.com/pivotal/products/json-on-hadoop-example-for-extending-hawq-data-formats-using-pivotal-extension-framework-pxf&gt;.

Thank you again for joining us and we will see you next time.
