CLOUD FOUNDRY FOUNDATION LAUNCH: GOVERNANCE BY CONTRIBUTION AND THE CLOUD FOUNDRY FOUNDATION
Read &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/cloud-foundry-pivotal/news-2/governance-by-contribution-and-the-cloud-foundry-foundation&gt; Paul Maritz&apos;s blog on the official launch of the Cloud Foundry Foundation.
 
 A group of companies, most of which have considerable experience in the good and the bad of open source, have come together to define a model of governance which is designed to allow broad participation and experimentation. Driving this approach is the principle of “governance by contribution” – a path to allow those who wish to meaningfully contribute, and exhibit real understanding, to earn the right to control the evolution.

EPISODE #10: WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 7TH
&lt;http://pivotal.io/podcasts&gt;
Join us &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/podcasts&gt; this week for &apos;Using Pivotal CF for Blue/Green Deployment&apos;, Episode #9 of our ongoing podcast series.

Getting new features into the hands of your customers sounds great, but it can be a little trickier than it looks. How do you ensure that a change does not “break” the system? How do you roll-back if something bad happens? How do you deploy a change so that no traffic is lost, packets are dropped or transactions missed?

Fortunately Pivotal CF provides built-in capability to handle this complexity for you. In this episode, we will dive more deeply into the concept of Blue/Green deployments, and the mechanism used by Pivotal CF to deploy changes into production with zero downtime and no packets dropped!
