    <textOnly>Spring@Pivotal User Group
Join us &lt;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/spring-data-for-jpa-mongodb-and-hadoop-event-organised-by-springsourcepivotal-tickets-10125440465&gt; on Thursday, January 16, 2014 Spring@Pivotal User Group Meetup. This conference is a free event organised by Pivotal. It will be hosted by our partner Next U at their facility in Bras Basah. 


We will be covering 2 exciting topics: 

From traditional Database access to Spring Data JPA and Spring Data MongoDB

Nik Trevallyn-Jones has worked in the IT industry for over 20 years and has been an active member of the Spring community for more than five years.  He has taught Spring courses to over 1000 students already.

Nik has an extensive background in computer software architecture, design and programming and is an active open-source contributor and has been involved in a number of projects including Spring Roo and Spring HATEOAS.

Nik will be starting from a traditional JPA application and will show you how to migrate it to Spring Data JPA. He will then show you how to use Spring Data with MongoDB. All the code shown in this presentation will be available publicly on github so you can download our samples after the presentation.

Hadoop made simple with Spring Data Hadoop

Kailash Kutti &lt;http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=12975252&gt; is a Technical architect with 14+ years of industry experience.
