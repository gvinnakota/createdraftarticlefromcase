    <subject>Pivotal Labs Presents: LAUNCH Beacon (NYC, June 16) – Limited Free Tickets</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=}},
 
In case you missed our Mobile &amp; Wearables &lt;http://events.launch.co/mobile/&gt; event last year, you certainly don’t want to miss LAUNCH Beacon &lt;http://events.launch.co/beacon&gt; taking place in NYC June 16th. 
Beacon will focus on the intersection of Retail, Payments and Locations and will bring together some of the hottest emerging companies and disrupters in the space.  Hosted by the folks at LAUNCH &lt;http://launch.co/about/&gt; and backed by us @ Pivotal Labs &lt;http://www.pivotallabs.com/&gt;, this one-day invite 
only “meet-up” (we hate the term conference) will feature a combination of demos, fireside chats,breakouts and more.
 
As a valued partner and customer, I’d like to offer a complimentary ticket for you to attend.  Please reply all and we’ll sort you out.
 
Hope to see you there!
