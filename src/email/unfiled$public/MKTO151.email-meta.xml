Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Visit Booth #106 to check out our latest Hadoop innovations, including the brand new capabilities of Pivotal HD, or talk one-on-one with our big data specialists about our recent announcements.

This week, Pivotal debuted two significant additions to our big data portfolio. These products represent our continued commitment to helping enterprise customers maximize value from all their data.

Pivotal™ Data Dispatch is a scalable and cost-effective solution that empowers the data worker by providing a consolidated view of disparate data sources, self-service sandbox provisioning for reporting and analytics. Companies can now rapidly and securely establish IT approved environments for end users to access internal and external datasets from Hadoop, NoSQL, traditional databases and beyond.&gt;&gt; http://www.gopivotal.com/pivotal-products/data/pivotal-data-dispatch

We are also bringing closed loop analytics to Hadoop with Pivotal GemFire™ XD. Tightly integrated with Pivotal HD, Pivotal GemFire XD works with HAWQ, which adds SQL’s expressive power to Hadoop, to provide the industry’s first platform for leveraging in-memory real-time transaction processing using Hadoop as the common storage substrate.
Want to know more about Pivotal’s Hadoop distribution with GemFire XD? Check out goPivotal.com/phd &lt;goPivotal.com/phd&gt; and learn how to generate business value from all your data.&gt;&gt; http://www.gopivotal.com/pivotal-products/data/pivotal-hd

We look forward to seeing you in New York!
