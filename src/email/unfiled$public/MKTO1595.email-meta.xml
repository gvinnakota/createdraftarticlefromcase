    <subject>Top Ways to Watch TV in 2014: Following up on the &quot;Changing the Channel&quot; Report You Downloaded</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 
You recently downloaded our report &quot;Changing the Channel: Are You Ready for Next-Generation TV?&quot;, which I hope you found informative. 
 
In the last year, nearly two million Americans cancelled their cable TV service. “Cord cutters” and “cord nevers” everywhere are migrating towards new TV options that are not only smarter technology, but also less expensive.
 
Access our presentation about which smart TVs, set-top boxes, streaming sticks and mobile apps are leading the competition, what products should be on your radar, and how consumers today have a lot of options.
 
Watch the presentation here &lt;http://www.slideshare.net/PivotalLabs/top-ways-to-watch-tv-in-2014-29662429&gt;.
