    <subject>Federation Announcement</subject>
    <textOnly>Pivotal Team -

Joe Tucci made the announcement below earlier this morning. Pivotal&apos;s alignment with the Federation continues to be strategically important to our success. This announcement reinforces the importance of the Federation proactively engaging as a team with these targeted customers. More details to follow as we align with Jeff and his team on this important initiative.



----------------------------------



The Federation was created with a singular vision at its core – to deliver superior value, integrated solutions and a seamless experience to our collective 
customers. Over the past year we have made many changes aligned with this vision including new integrated solutions such as the Federation Enterprise Hybrid Cloud, shared goals, and shared incentives across our Federation sales teams.

Today, we are announcing another important 
step designed to further enhance the value we can offer to our largest, most strategic customers around the world. I have asked Jeff Casale, VMware’s Corporate Senior Vice President for the Americas, to take on a new role focused on coordinating how the EMC Federation of companies jointly organize for, sell to and serve this select group of global customers. In this role, he will report directly to me and will work together with the leaders of our Federation.

This is a huge opportunity for us. We consistently hear our large customers asking us to be better coordinated and to work together in a more integrated fashion. In his new role, Jeff will architect and lead a cross-Federation strategy designed to help our most strategic customers transform their IT operations, radically improve efficiencies, and harness the power of mobile, cloud and big data. Jeff and his new team will be working in close collaboration with our existing Federation businesses and we will announce more details in the near future.

Jeff is perfectly suited for this critical task, having 25 years of experience in global sales and services at 
both VMware and EMC. He joined VMware five years ago to lead business operations for the Americas, after previously spending nearly 20 years at EMC, where he led global channels, OEMs and go-to-market strategy, and held executive and operational leadership positions for sales and services across Latin America 
and EMEA.

Please join me in congratulating Jeff on his new role and in giving him your total support to make our Federation work better together for our largest customers.
