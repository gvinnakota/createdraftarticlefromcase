    <textOnly>Webinar: Building Big Data Applications with Hadoop &amp; Spring
We&apos;re glad you were able to join us.
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
Thank you for joining us for our third installment in the &quot;What You Can Do With Hadoop&quot; webinar series. We explored how Spring XD (Xtreme Data) is addressing Big Data Application needs such as:


 - High throughput distributed data ingestion into HDFS from a variety of input sources.
 - Real-time analytics at ingestion time, e.g. gathering metrics and counting values.
 - Hadoop workflow management via batch jobs.
 - High throughput data export, e.g. from HDFS to a RDBMS or NoSQL database. 


An on demand broadcast (replay) is available on our website &lt;http://bitcast-a.v1.o1.sjc1.bitgravity.com/greenplum/pivotalvideo/Building-Big-Data-Applications-with-Hadoop-Spring-WEB.m4v&gt;.
