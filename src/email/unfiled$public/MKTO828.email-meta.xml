Speaker: Juergen Hoeller and the Spring Team

Did you miss the “Introduction to Spring Framework 4.0” launch event? Not to worry. Due to the popular demand for the original event, Pivotal is holding overflow webinars for the Spring Framework 4.0 launch webinar. Limit is 1000 per event, so register soon!

The Spring Framework re-invented enterprise Java in the last decade. Together with the rest of the upcoming Spring IO micro platform, a new Spring Framework generation will power the next decade of JVM-based innovation.

Join Juergen Hoeller and the Spring Team to learn about Spring Framework 4.0, its refined annotation-based component and configuration model, and how it relates to Java 8, Java EE 7, Groovy, WebSockets, as well as Spring Boot and Spring Integration.
