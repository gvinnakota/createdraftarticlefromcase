EPISODE #7: A look at 12-factor apps, Wednesday, NOVEMBER 19TH
&lt;http://pivotal.io/podcasts&gt;
Join us this week for &quot;A Look at 12-Factor Apps&quot;, Episode #7 of our ongoing podcast series.

Good software architects and infrastructure architects are people who are willing to challenge their own thinking, to learn different ways of doing things, and to understand what the state of the art is. They ask, &apos;What are other people doing and how are they building their applications? How can I apply this to what I&apos;m doing?&apos;

The 12 Factor App is a sort of manifesto created out of Heroku, which did a lot of great work on how one should build web scout apps for current requirements and how that may work in a cloud spaced world.

AN EASIER WAY TO DEPLOY CASSANDRA CLUSTERS
&lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/cloud-foundry-pivotal/features/an-easier-way-to-deploy-cassandra-clusters&gt;
The majority of applications being built today require some form of data service, whether its a traditional relational database or a highly-available Cassandra cluster to provide a key-value store. This is why building out a broad ecosystem of data services for application developers to choose from is an important part of the Pivotal CF (PCF) offering. Today, Pivotal and DataStax announce the next milestone in this journey with new support for Operators to install the DataStax Enterprise database cluster onto their PCF platform as an add on service.
