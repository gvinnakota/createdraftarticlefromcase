    <subject>Pivotal One Launches, Now Every Enterprise Can Develop Like An Internet Giant</subject>
    <textOnly>“If you’re in the business of building enterprise software, scrambling to figure out what your company is doing around big data and analytics, mobile and the cloud, then there’s a fair chance you’ll want to pay attention to Pivotal.” 
 - All Things D, Arik Hesseldahl
Pivotal One, the World’s First Next-Generation Multi-Cloud Enterprise PaaS.
It has been six months since we formed Pivotal, with the promise of developing a new platform for a new era. On November 12th, we delivered on that promise with Pivotal One – a next-generation platform that aims to significantly accelerate how companies build, deploy, scale and manage data-centric applications in the cloud. 
Summary of the Announcements:

 - Pivotal CF – the commercial offering built on top of the open-source Cloud Foundry platform, is now available on VMware&apos;s vSphere. It provides a turnkey PaaS experience for agile development teams to rapidly scale applications on a private cloud that can be instantly expanded and upgraded with no downtime.
 - Pivotal One services – including Pivotal HD, Pivotal AX, Pivotal RabbitMQ and MySQL will not only support enterprise requirements for automatic application binding and service provisioning, but also help usher in the era of Big Data to the enterprise cloud.
