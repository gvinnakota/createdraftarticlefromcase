EXPLORATORY DATA SCIENCE: WHEN TO USE AN MPP DATABASE, SQL ON HADOOP OR MAP REDUCE
&lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal/products/exploratory-data-science-when-to-use-an-mpp-database-sql-on-hadoop-or-map-reduce&gt;
The members of the Pivotal Data Labs team are often asked what tools and platforms we use to analyze large datasets and build cutting edge predictive models. Some of our colleagues recently presented a talk &lt;http://www.datasciencecentral.com/video/dsc-webinar-series-data-science-for-the-99-open-source-software&gt; on the open source software used by our team, while in this post we will consider the importance of choosing the right platform and focus on exploratory data science. We always want to use the right tool for the right job, which means understanding what data processing is needed, performance requirements, and budgetary limitations.

In a follow-up to the popular talk &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OkmVTFhfLY&gt; at CF Summit discussing how and why the Cloud Foundry team is rewriting one of the existing Cloud Foundry components, namely the DEA, in Go (codenamed “Diego” appropriately), Cloud Foundry engineer Amit Gupta shares the details of how the DEA optimizes scaling applications across your available cloud resources. In this technical post, he reviews the new auction system, and illustrates the problem Diego solves by modelling it as a mathematical optimization problem.
