    <textOnly>All,

Thank you for taking the time to attend our December 18th Town Hall.

If you did not get a chance to attend or watch the webcast, the on-demand replay can be found here Town Hall Replay &lt;https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fsites.google.com%2Fa%2Fpivotal.io%2Finside-pivotal%2Fpivotal-town-hall&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEmEZfn61I_iK0WC4bSuLpC8wp_tQ&gt; (requires Okta authentication).

We received more questions than we had time to answer during the Town Hall event, so we intend to get all questions answered and posted to Inside Pivotal in the coming days.

Please reach out to any of us on the executive staff or to your managers with comments or questions.

Best,

-Joe</textOnly>
