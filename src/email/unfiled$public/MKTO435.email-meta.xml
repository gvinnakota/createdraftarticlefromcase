Organizations of all sizes and across all industries are using data science to solve problems, find new opportunities and achieve actionable results.

Empowered by sharing ideas and methods, the data science team 
at Pivotal leverages and contributes to the community of publicly available and open source technologies as part of their practice. From data exploration and visualization to feature engineering, model building and scoring, the Pivotal data science team uses open source tools extensively.

In this webinar, members of the team will discuss some of the open source tools in the Pivotal Data Labs (PDL) arsenal. If you haven&apos;t registered yet, please join us &lt;http://bit.ly/P1FYEk&gt; for this unique opportunity to learn more about the variety of tools – such as MADlib, PL/R, PL/Python, PivotalR, PyMADlib and a host of others – they have
