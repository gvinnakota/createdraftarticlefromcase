    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Oil and gas exploration and production activities generate large amounts of data from sensors, logistics, business operations and more. In this webinar &lt;http://w.on24.com/r.htm?e=919431&amp;s=1&amp;k=5F7F06AF4328BD7860A7034BBC6A6099&amp;partnerref=Pivotal&gt;, Rashmi Raghu (Senior Data Scientist, Pivotalâ€‹) will highlight how the Pivotal Data Labs 
team created a failure prediction model from sensor and operator data. Models such as these can be used to build essential early warning systems, reduce costs and minimize unplanned downtime. 

Given the volume, variety and velocity, gaining actionable and relevant insights from this data is challenging. Join us &lt;http://w.on24.com/r.htm?e=919431&amp;s=1&amp;k=5F7F06AF4328BD7860A7034BBC6A6099&amp;partnerref=Pivotal&gt; to learn about these challenges and how to address them by leveraging Big Data 
technologies.
