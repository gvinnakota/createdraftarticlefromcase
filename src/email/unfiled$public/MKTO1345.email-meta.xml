Building “Bootful” UIs with Spring Boot and Vaadin
Speaker: Josh Long

It&apos;s been a long day, but you&apos;ve done it: you&apos;ve got a Spring Boot powered backend and now you need to build the UI that&apos;ll power the workforce and deliver next week. Vaadin, a UI framework that marries the ease of use of server-side Java and the rich, dynamic nature of client-side JavaScript, integrates well with Spring Boot and offers UI polish that would be hard to secure any other way.

Join Spring developer advocate Josh Long and Vaadin evangelists for a look at how Vaadin and Spring Boot can get you to production quicker, and easier.

Security for Microservices with Spring and OAuth2
Speaker: Dave Syer

OAuth2 is a lightweight security protocol that is well-suited for use with HTTP, the protocol at the heart of many modern architectures. Spring Security OAuth2 has a load of new features, not the least of which being the `@Configuration` support in version 2.0. Combine these with Spring Boot and you have a platform which can get you a secure HTTP service application in about 20 lines of code.

This presentation shows how the combination of rapid development and production-ready features in the modern Spring stack are a perfect mixture for developing secure components in a system composed of microservices. We explore the new features in Spring OAuth2, guide you through the choice of which to use and when, and show how easy they are to enable quickly.
