    <subject>Operations Organizational Update</subject>
    <textOnly>Team, 

As we prepare Pivotal to round the corner going into 2015 with a streamlined Product R&amp;D organization under Rob Mee, we similarly want to streamline our overall organizational efficiency for taking our products to market. 

As such, we&apos;re asking Todd Paoletti to run a unified Global Operations function reporting to me. Todd will establish sound GTM processes, methodologies and measurement across product lifecycle, business functions and execution in the field. The goal is to improve Pivotal GTM efficiency from strategic planning through execution.

The Global Operations organization will be comprised of:


 - Product Operations, led by Corinne Lewy
 - Global Field Operations and Inside Sales, led by Greg Stroud 
 - Customer Reference Programs, led by Sophia Tseng
 - Field Enablement, led by Jennifer O&apos;Neill



During 2014, Todd established a strong Product Marketing global team and function to help Pivotal focus and achieve GTM stability during a transition year. With Data and Pivotal CF product marketing teams well established, and to maintain tight GTM alignment, these Product Marketing functions will now report into their Data and Pivotal CF Product Management leads, or Sunny Madra and James Watters, respectively. 

This is an exciting time for Pivotal. With Todd&apos;s acumen and leadership, our strong operational teams will improve our ability to execute against a phenomenal market opportunity, with great products and a great field going into 2015. 

Make it happen!</textOnly>
