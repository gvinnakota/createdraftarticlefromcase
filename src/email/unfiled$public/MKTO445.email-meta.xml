    <textOnly>Thanks for visiting us in New York!
An impressive speaker lineup, combined with leading technology vendors, and a multitude of data-driven attendees, made GigaOM Structure Data a top-notch industry event. 

Pivotal CEO, Paul Maritz and GigaOM’s Om Malik discussed why a new type of data needs a new type of platform. &quot;We are going to build a new platform, and the legacy has to cleave to that, not the other way around” stated Maritz.Visit the Pivotal P.O.V.
