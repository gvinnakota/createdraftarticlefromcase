    <subject>Announcing the 2015 Reference Incentive Program, and Q1 Wins Analysis Now available</subject>
    <textOnly>Congrats to all on the best Q1 in Pivotal&apos;s history. Some excellent momentum this quarter across the Data business with new logos like Tyco, and Time magazine, as well as wins at existing customers like Inovalon and TIM Wireless who have decided to underscore their strategic investments in our data portfolio with expanded footprints. Labs also saw a strong showing this quarter with new engagements at Home Depot, EMC, TD Ameritrade, and more.

We have continued analysis of Top Pivotal CF, Big Data Suite, and Labs this quarter. As always you can find anonymized, scripted business case slides &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/customer-marketing-and-programs/assets/external-slides&gt; you can use to share these stories, as well as detailed wins analysis. And again, in response to your feedback we have continued what we started in Q4 of last year, making the actual interviews with the reps who have won these deals available in downloadable mp4 format for your use on the road.

Congratulations also to our Pivotal Reference Champions in 2014 &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/customer-marketing-and-programs/2014-award-winners&gt;. Joe Hold was the top Champion, winning the Rolex Grand Prize at SKO 2015, but many of your peers had their clients participate in our reference programs to make up the 2014 Pivotal Reference Champion Leaderboard.

We&apos;re excited to unveil the 2015 Reference Incentive Program &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/customer-marketing-and-programs/references/2015-prize-catalog&gt; with brand new prizes from your survey feedback. This year&apos;s top prize is 5000 Pivotal Stock Options, and the catalog also includes Custom Suits, The Apple Watch, Courtside tickets to the Golden State Warriors, Charitable Donations, and more. Continue to encourage your peers to log their reference requests through Salesforce.com &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/customer-marketing-and-programs/references/reference-system&gt;, and respond to reference requests when you 
receive them. If you have Data, Pivotal CF, or Labs customers who are ready to go external with us, get in touch &lt;mailto:customer-marketing@pivotal.io&gt; to involve them in reference activity &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/customer-marketing-and-programs/references/2014-activity-point-values&gt;.

If you have questions or comments on any of the above, please let Sophia Tseng &lt;mailto:stseng@pivotal.io&gt; know.
