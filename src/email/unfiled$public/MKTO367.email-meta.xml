Join Pivotal development veteran Ivan Novick and Senior Field Engineer Louie Mugnano, along with a few familiar faces and industry colleagues, for a little plummie hospitality and a chance to learn and share.


We&apos;ll walk through a new revision of the database and hear useful tips and techniques - followed by the opportunity for you to talk with other users about the ways they are working with Pivotal GPDB to enable their own teams and advance good business practices.



Come see how far Pivotal has come and just where we&apos;re all going.
