    <subject>Introducing Pivotal One</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Colleagues, 

As we stated when we formally launched Pivotal, our mission is to deliver a new platform for a new era. Just six months since then, the product of your hard work has allowed us to introduce Pivotal One, and make this promise real. 

Mark Andreessen famously said that &quot;Software is eating the world&quot;… Pivotal One will help our customers rediscover software and all it can do. It does this by providing a comprehensive integrated set of application and data services that run on top of Pivotal CF, our enterprise distribution of Cloud Foundry. Our hope is that this new platform will enable agile teams to build applications and harness data across a variety of cloud infrastructures – and in so doing unlock innovation for our customers and enable them to do things that only the consumer Internet giants have been able to do. 

Today&apos;s introduction is the culmination of significant collaboration from across our global organization, and includes the following teams: CF BOSH, CF Operator (formerly known as Tempest), CF Services, CF CLI / Console, CF Elastic Runtime, CF Identity, CF Java Buildpack, CF Java Tooling, Pivotal RabbitMQ, Pivotal Analytics, Pivotal HD, and Pivotal Network. It is this kind of teamwork that will enable us to really lead. 

You can follow all announcement activities (including today&apos;s public facing webcast at 10am PST &lt;http://gopivotal.com/theplatform&gt;, press release, blog posts, and other digital assets) by viewing the story on gopivotal.com &lt;gopivotal.com&gt;, Inside Pivotal &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/home?pli=1&gt; and/or Socialcast &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/login&gt;. 

 Thank you all for your contributions and commitment. I am confident that today&apos;s announcement will enable us to set the bar for a modern enterprise PaaS.

Paul
