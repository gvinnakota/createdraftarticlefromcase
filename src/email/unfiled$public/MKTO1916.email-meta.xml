    <textOnly>Spring XD: A Platform for data at scale and developer productivity
Speaker: Sabby Anandan, Mark Fisher &amp; Mark Pollack

Worried about Big Data and the challenges inherent in making a real application? You donâ€™t have to worry anymore! Spring XD provides a one-stop shop solution that spans traditional enterprise to Big Data use cases - both batch and streaming. It&apos;s important to choose the right tool for each use-case, which is why Spring XD integrates with technologies such as Spark, Reactor and RxJava to demonstrate the flexibility and the unified programming model to support complex data computation use-cases.

In this webinar, we&apos;ll show you how to develop data-driven use cases much faster than other big data solutions on the out of the box XD runtime.

Introducing Spring Session
Speaker: Josh Long

Back in the era of the application server, HTTP Session replication was a common way to scale out user session data, as well as make it fault tolerant. In today&apos;s world of lightweight containers, PaaS, and virtualization, Spring Session offers a 100% server and/or container portable HTTP Session.

See how Spring Session easily plugs in implementations like Redis, scales out across a cluster, handles multiple users&apos; browser sessions, works with WebSocket, and allows header based authentication within REST apps. It&apos;s a perfect fit for working with user data, particularly in a highly distributed environment like the cloud, or on a Platform like Cloud Foundry.
