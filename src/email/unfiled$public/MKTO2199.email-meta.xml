If the Superlative Fits

Steve Casale &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1033819-stephencasale&gt;, Sr. Manager, Corporate Communications
The problem with claims like “industry leading, or “most complete” is often what’s not behind them. Like a timid knight in platinum armor, mediocrity is something no superlative can cover for long.



Pushing the technical levers on portability as far as they go, Pivotal Cloud Foundry announced availability on AWS &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/cloud-foundry-pivotal/products/pivotal_cloud_foundry_on_amazon_web_services&gt; last week, and added free hosting &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/cloud-foundry-pivotal/products/free-hosting-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry&gt;. This makes complex cloud scale-outs easier and faster, and time-to-value very real for businesses. Developers who offer services on Pivotal Cloud Foundry love the rich features, feeding a DevOps culture of building fast, shipping early, and pivoting as needed.



Cindy Lee introduces Greenplum’s brand new query optimizer, which solves an old problem of scale and speed, and we glimpse a new Federation Business Data Lake &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/big-data-pivotal/news-2/new-federation-business-data-lake-should-be-your-silver-bullet-for-big-data-success&gt; that meets customers at any stage of their journey to modern big data. We’re delighted to have agile “fomenter”, Janice Fraser, report about our new collaboration with Eric Ries.



We also unearthed a gem: A Pivotal Labs app for a customer that is a truly new interpretation of the digital wallet (see Customer Spotlight).



Some of these projects took time, or had a bruising path to the finish. Many are certifiable firsts. We sometimes make mighty claims, but we intend to live up to them.



Being ahead of a market is tricky though, so we’re happy to have an update from the Pivotal Education team, and their work to train up customers and seed markets.



Enjoy.
BUSINESS UPDATE

This Federation Data Lake Runs Deep

Craig Steel &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1086765-craigsteel&gt;, GM, Pivotal Global Alliances, EMC Team
On March 23rd, EMC officially launched version 1.0 of the Federation Business Data Lake (FBDL) with notable fanfare, logging over 43,000 hits on its official launch site &lt;http://vts.inxpo.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:1;F:US!100&amp;PreviousLoginCount=NULL&amp;ForceProfileToBeFilledOut=0&amp;DisplayItem=NULL&amp;ShowKey=23126&amp;ShowFrameFormatOverride=NULL&amp;RandomValue=1427420040609&gt;, 1207 unique views in the first 24 hours, an EMC launch record! To put this in context, the launch of EHC &lt;http://www.emc.com/cloud/hybrid-cloud-computing/index.htm&gt; took 10 days to hit the same milestone. There were dozens of articles and hundreds of tweets. The new Federation &lt;http://www.emcfederation.com/&gt; partnership makes it easy for customers at any stage of their data journey to build a data lake and leverage big data analytics.



It’s a complete Federation story: Built on EMC storage and EMC Data Lake Foundations; with VMware vSphere running on Vblocks with Isilon; while Pivotal Big Data Suite &lt;https://pivotal.io/big-data/pivotal-big-data-suite&gt; (BDS) and Pivotal Cloud Foundry &lt;https://pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/pivotal-cloud-foundry&gt; (PCF) products are fundamental to the core architecture.



The openness at the heart of the Federation Data Lake helps customers transition to modern data management. It allows for choice in Hadoop distributions and third-party databases, as well as analytics products such as Tableau and SAS. With a host of EMC services and education tools, we ease migrations to the data lake for customers at various stages of big data investment and maturity.



Aidan O’Brien, who runs the Big Data Solutions team at EMC and led this Federation effort, summarized its plans in 2015. “You will see the expansion of our Big Data Solution, story and ecosystem. There will be additional refreshes of the Big Data Playbook and EMC.com/bigdata &lt;http://www.emc.com/bigdata&gt; experience. In the second half of the year, we’ll also be taking and expanding the initial Business Data Lake enablement plan that is currently focused on 16 accounts across the three theatres.”



We’re super excited to be part of the Federation Big Data Lake, and to see dedicated EMC resources focused on growing its revenue. If you missed the live launch, I encourage you to take an hour to watch the replay &lt;https://vts.inxpo.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=L:0&amp;AI=1&amp;InitialDisplay=1&amp;ClientBrowser=0&amp;ShowKey=23126&amp;RFR=BDS-AOEmai&gt;, or at least check out a 2-minute summary &lt;http://www.emc.com/big-data/marketing.htm?vid=4129201113001&gt;.

PRODUCT UPDATE

A Pivotal Original Fires Up Modern Data Analytics

Cindy Lee &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/912723-cindylee&gt;, Principal Product Manager, Greenplum Database
Big data has sparked a renewed interest in query optimization – that is, the most efficient way to execute a given query. This is pushing the envelope for unprecedented scalability, availability and processing capabilities in order to serve up massive data sets of hundreds of terabytes (or petabytes), for analysis through SQL or SQL-like interfaces.
 
 The performance of analytical query processing in 
databases depends heavily on the system&apos;s query optimizer. Massive data volumes and the heightened interest in optimizing complex analytical queries all led Pivotal to build a new query optimizer that could manage modern big data workloads.
 
 After extensive R&amp;D, the Pivotal Query Optimizer (PQO) &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/attachments/3046749&gt;, the world’s newest and first query optimizer for big data, will be released on April 6th with Pivotal Greenplum Database 4.3.5. &lt;https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-gpdb&gt; The PQO (formerly called ORCA &lt;https://pivotal.io/big-data/white-paper/orca-a-modular-query-optimizer-architecture-for-big-data&gt;) unites state-of-the-art query optimization technology with original Pivotal research – resulting in a powerful, extensible optimizer designed specifically to meet the demands of today’s analytic workloads.
 
 The PQO lives up to its name. Its unique features and exceptional performance and scalability distinguish it from other optimizers in every important category:


 - Extensibility – By representing all query elements (and their optimization) on equal footing, PQO is highly scalable. It avoids the trap of multi-phase optimization, which deprioritizes some optimizations, subsequently making it notoriously difficult to extend, because new query constructs or optimizations often do not match previously set boundaries.
 - Multi-Core Readiness – The PQO deploys a highly-efficient, multi-core aware scheduler that distributes individual, fine-grained optimization subtasks across multiple CPU cores. In other words, it’s about scaled-out optimization at great speeds.
 - Verifiability – The PQO has special provisions, built-in mechanisms for ascertaining correctness and performance. In addition to improving engineering practices, these tools enable rapid development with high confidence, and reduce turnaround times for new features as well as bug fixes.
 - Performance – The PQO is a substantial improvement over its predecessor, the Planner Optimizer, performing queries at 10x to 1000x faster!



Finally, huge congratulations to the Query Processing team – Lyublena Antova &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/940773-lyublenaantova&gt;, George Caragea &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/947596-georgecaragea&gt;, Jimmy Da &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/919407-jimmyda&gt;, Amr El-Helw &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/940772-amrelhelw&gt;, Noa Horn &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/949803-noahorn&gt;, Carlos Garcia-Alvarado &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/940783-carlosgarciaalvarado&gt;, Jesse Zhang &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1032267-jessezhang&gt;, Michalis Petropoulos &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/940256-michalispetropoulos&gt;, Venkatesh Raghavan &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/942016-venkateshraghavan&gt;, Foyzur Rahman &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/953606-foyzurrahman&gt;, Saurin Shah &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1032658-saurinshah&gt;, Entong Shen &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/943369-entongshen&gt;, Mohamed Soliman &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/968396-mohamedsoliman&gt; and Sujeet Varakhedi &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/946860-sujeetvarakhedi&gt; – on this 
monumental achievement!
AGILE UPDATE

Agile, Lean, and a Transformation Blueprint

Janice Fraser &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1080303-janicefraser&gt;, Director, Innovation Practice, Pivotal
Last month, we announced a fantastic partnership between Pivotal and Eric Ries, &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal/news-2/pivotal-and-eric-ries-partners-for-enterprise-transformation&gt; the best-selling author of The Lean Startup &lt;http://theleanstartup.com/&gt;. Eric has been a long-time friend of Pivotal Labs, and has asked Pivotal to be a key partner in the launch of his latest, limited-edition book project, The Leader&apos;s Guide &lt;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/881308232/only-on-kickstarter-the-leaders-guide-by-eric-ries&gt;. In the book, Eric will share the tools, techniques and lessons that he uses with Fortune 1000 companies like GE and Intuit.



But there is much more to come…



Eric understands how challenging agile transformation can be. &quot;I’ve seen a lot of people who immediately “got” it,&quot; he says. But they &quot;struggle after experiencing the challenges that come when trying to build a new company, or transform an existing one.&quot;



We&apos;re thrilled to announce that Pivotal Labs&apos; Innovation Practice &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=cGl2b3RhbC5pb3xwaXZvdGFsd2lraXxneDo0NjdhMWNlMzBlNTUyMzcw&gt; will be among the first in the world to put the Leader&apos;s Guide into practice. Our Innovation Practice provides workshops that help clients make bold steps and navigate difficult decisions on the path to becoming successful digital companies.



Over the coming months, and with the help of Eric Ries, Pivotal will be developing a one-day workshop to introduce the concepts, tools and techniques outlined in the Lean Startup and Leader&apos;s Guide – offering a blueprint for transformation.



Pivotal Labs facilitators will deliver Innovation Workshops in 11 cities, starting in October.



Stay tuned for details!

Design digital products and the way users interact with them for Pivotal Labs. I also host Pivotal Palo Alto’s Lunch Time Draw Time (every third Friday of the month at 12:30pm). If you haven’t been, then you should – it’s the most fun you can have in a conference room.
Out with users getting to know them and how they work – either chatting with them or watching Nat-Geo style while trying to fit important insights on a 3” x 3” Post-it note.
Wrapping up one engagement with a Pivotal Labs client in the high tech server infrastructure space. Who know’s what next? There’s never a dull moment as a consultant!
I’m probably out exploring with my pup &lt;https://instagram.com/ohiathedog&gt;. If you’re ever in the Palo Alto Office while she’s around, she loves treats. Ask her to “sneeze,” it’s wild!





Clockwise l to r: Prague by boat; dog’s birthday in style!; Richard and Pivotal design crew
Long before coming to work here, a few of my smart engineering friends and I were so inspired by a visit to Pivotal Labs that we started our own consultancy, Amoeba Labs. Needless to say, it helped prepare me for the real thing.
Represents a lot of what’s interesting and exciting about building digital solutions.
Welcome to Pivotal!
We’re happy you’re here! Please welcome the new employees who joined Pivotal from March 17th to 30th
