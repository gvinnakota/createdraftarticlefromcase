EDITOR WELCOME
 The Gospel of Pivotal
 Steve Casale &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1033819-stephencasale&gt;, Sr. Manager, Corporate Communications
Throughout the summer 37 college and graduate interns started etching futures from Pivotal offices across the globe. Another partnership in learning was launched by Pivotal Labs and developer training pros Galvanize, through a hands-on apprenticeship in agile methodology for aspiring coders.
 
 And on 19 August, Pivotal’s technical leaders will hit the road and multiple cities across North 
America and then span the globe to open the hood on Pivotal CF. With the Cloud Platform Roadshow &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/events/pivotal-cloud-platform-roadshow?pli=1&gt; Pivotal will show developers everywhere how to build and deploy great 
applications from a modern cloud platform. (Contact Paul Santos &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/921583-paulsantos&gt; for more information!)
 
 In this issue you’ll also see the quieter power of quality engineering and all it does to sustain product excellence, and how a partnership with Capgemini has yielded industry leadership.
 
 The word on Pivotal is out and spreading fast. Organizations want to learn not just what we do, but how we do it. Enjoy!
BUSINESS UPDATE
 Pivotal and Capgemini – A Winning Alliance
 Nick Cayou &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/912515-nickcayou&gt;, VP, Alliances
Many at Pivotal will recall that Pivotal and Capgemini &lt;http://www.capgemini.com/?ref-kw=capgemini_united_states-Broad&amp;gclid=CIzIx9778r8CFStgMgodjRkA0Q&gt; began a strategic partnership late last year. It was a departure from the traditional systems integrator/vendor paradigm, and more in the spirit of co-innovation that characterizes Pivotal’s approach with clients and the open source community. Through this partnership, we jointly launched the industry’s first Business Data Lake &lt;http://www.capgemini.com/big-data-analytics/business-data-lake&gt; solution.
 
 There has been an amazing ramp up in 
Capgemini’s ability to engage clients and deliver Pivotal technologies since our launch. They have invested in a dedicated Pivotal global business development team, built a Pivotal Center of Excellence in India, and joined the Cloud Foundry Foundation &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/press-release/cloud-foundry-foundation&gt;. This collective strategic vision of the Business Data Lake has been widely referenced and imitated across the industry.
 
 In short, the Capgemini and Pivotal team of Jocelyn Parker and John Funk have been seriously busy! The first-half results say it all:


 - 143 Capgemini engineers trained on Pivotal Big Data Suite
 - 100 joint customer opportunities
 - 11 proofs-of-concept underway
 - 11 joint RFP responses
 - $18M in Pivotal software revenue driven or influenced by Capgemini
 - 1 Pivotal Center of Excellence 
 - 2 Capgemini/Pivotal demo environments
 - 3 Dedicated Pivotal business development executives




 We expect to deepen this engagement in the second half, and drive greater integration with our Cloud Foundry assets. Stay tuned!

PRODUCT UPDATE
 The Fabric of Success — GPDB Quality Engineering 
 Ed Espino &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/949137-edwardespino&gt;, GPDB Quality and Release Engineering Manager, R&amp;D
Quality Engineering (QE) is the quiet force behind our great products. Throughout the year, the Pivotal GPDB &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/big-data/pivotal-greenplum-database&gt; (Greenplum Database) QE team has engaged across teams and processes to ensure excellence in the Data Fabric. Below are just some of the ways our relentless focus on quality is helping the business:
 
 Customers
 Anu Prabakar and Jimmy Yih represented Pivotal GPDB QE on our work with Morgan Stanley in New York. Exposure to use cases like this give us opportunities to review state-of-the-art production environments, and significantly raise quality.
 
 Review and Renew
 Hari Kodungallur, from Release Engineering, is spearheading a new effort (Release Express – RelEx) to overhaul a key build and test automation infrastructure. Through Agile methods, Pivotal GPDB release and hotfixes can be done at the push of a button – putting easier fixes into the hands of the engineers who most need them!
 
 Cross-pollination
 Our HAWQ and Pivotal GPDB QE teams are leveraging each other’s technical innovation. One example is the Memcheck/Valgrind tool (developed by Ivan Weng) for HAWQ. With slight modifications, it was retrofitted for Pivotal GPDB use. Future collaboration will include sharing HAWQ&apos;s stress and longevity environment, and iHook framework.
 
 Continuous Improvement
 From scrum teams to management, Data Fabric QE has embraced continuous improvement via weekly Kaizen sessions – yielding 
innovations in our automated build and test processes.
 
 Pivotal GPDB Pune QE Rocks
 Under Shatrughan Rai’s (Persistent Systems) leadership, our team in Pune has excelled. They have increased their regression test analysis velocity by 40% – which means faster product delivery times.
 
 Fun
 If you work hard, you might as well play hard! The Espino household hosted the entire team in Danville. We laughed, swam, feasted and - of course - had a quality time!

AGILE UPDATE
 The Hallowed Halls of Agile
 Imtiaz Jaffer &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/950206-imtiazjaffer&gt;, Director of Marketing, Pivotal Labs
We’re excited to share news on Pivotal Labs’ partnership with Galvanize &lt;http://www.galvanize.it/#welcome&gt; – the folks who offer the latest in quality developer training – to bring gSchool 
(Galvanize) students a new apprenticeship program. The new Pivotal Labs at gSchool &lt;http://pivotallabs.com/galvanize-launches-exclusive-apprenticeship-program-pivotal-labs/&gt; program gives developers real-world experience on actual customer projects, leveraging our 
agile methodology.
 
 A host of Pivotal Labs engineers already serve as instructors in the gSchool program, and some gSchool faculty are former Pivotal Labs engineers who have helped shape its curriculum.
 
 Under the new program, students will pair with Pivotal Labs engineers 
as part of their final three months in the gSchool immersion program. They’ll apply agile practices and gain real-world experience by working with Pivotal Labs’ clients. Students of Pivotal Labs at gSchool will benefit from a collaborative, disciplined apprenticeship – getting exposure both to production-level code and the fundamentals of agile.
 
 
 School Daze: gSchoolers immersed in all things Agile
 
 The first Pivotal Labs at gSchool is launching its Full Stack Development Immersive in the heart of San Francisco’s startup community. You can learn about the details here &lt;http://www.galvanize.it/pivotal-labs-at-gschool&gt;.
 
 We see software development as a team effort, and Galvanize shares this passion. We’re glad to spread the word about our new gSchool partners!

Earlier this summer, US-based interns had the opportunity to speak with Paul Maritz about Pivotal and his own path to success. They still made time within their busy schedules for networking and fun. Bay Area interns met with Rob Mee at the San Francisco Pivotal Labs office, and then took in a Giants baseball game at AT&amp;T Park. Despite the wind, cold, and loss by the Giants, everyone had a good time.
 
 Digital Marketing intern, Patrick Gillis, captured the experience nicely: &quot;Working at Pivotal has been inspirational. If I’ve learned one thing, is that it’s all about the team. The Pivotal team is exceptional--an interesting, smart, and fun group of people that I&apos;ve had the great privilege to work with.&quot;
 
 Bay Area interns will present their summer projects at the Tuesday Tech Talk in Palo Alto, on 19 August. Come meet the interns and hear more about their Pivotal experience, and wish them luck as they head back to school and post-graduate programs!

MY NAME IS...
 Shi Mingjiang
 Shi Mingjiang &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/921674-mingjiangshi&gt;, mostly known as &quot;MJ&quot; to my US colleagues.
Am a software engineer on the Shanghai Hadoop team, building the Pivotal HD distribution and developing tools around Hadoop.
In the Pivotal Shanghai office most of the time, which is located in the heart of the city in the Puxi area (about a mile inland from The Bund &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bund&gt;), or on weibo (the Chinese version of Twitter).  If you understand Chinese, check out my page &lt;http://weibo.com/mjshi&gt;.
Pivotal HD configuration advisor (PCA), a tool that recommends an optimized Hadoop configuration for deploying a Pivotal HD cluster. I plan to make it a Cloud Foundry application.  
 
 I am also implementing the Cluster Log Insights to make it easier for engineers to get most out of the Hadoop logs (this was a Pivotal Hackday &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/hackday/&gt; winning idea, and my Hackday partner Jun Sun’s &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/930245-junsun&gt; contribution was key to its success).
I practice Tai Chi and spend time with my 2.5-year-old boy (see photo)
