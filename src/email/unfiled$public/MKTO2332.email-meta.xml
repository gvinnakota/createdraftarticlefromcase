    <textOnly>Reactive data-pipelines with Spring XD and Kafka
Speakers: Marius Bogoevici &amp; Mark Pollack

In the recent years, drastic increases in data volume as well as a greater demand for low latency and high responsiveness has led to a radical shift in business requirements and application development methods. These needs have been addresses, by concepts such as reactive programming and reactive streams that ensure a high responsiveness even under increased data throughput.

Spring XD natively supports asynchronous event-driven programming with observable streams through its integrations with RxJava and Project Reactor. With its own integration built on Kafka&apos;s Simple Consumer API, Spring XD emphasizes the strengths and specifics of Kafka as a transport based on the model of a high-throughput distributed log, while providing the flexibility to support partitioning, offset management and replayability, and generally preserving and emphasizing.

Joining the power of observable streams and Kafka, in this webinar, we will demonstrate how to build data-centric reactive pipelines at enterprise scale.
