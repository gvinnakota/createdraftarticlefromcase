    <textOnly>Asia Pacific Summit - Oct 23-24
Thank You For Joining Pivotal
Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madame}},

I wanted to personally thank you for attending this year&apos;s inaugural Asia Pacific Summit in Singapore last week. With over 400 attendees helping us to cut the ribbon to open The Pivotal Innovation Centre and introduce Pivotal&apos;s first Summit of its kind in the region, I am excited at the momentum Pivotal is creating. This is an extraordinary time for software and I&apos;m thrilled to be at the center of it.
On November 12, Pivotal will be announcing something very special. Please join me &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/theplatform&gt; and my colleagues at 10AM to found out what platform the next great software companies will use. We will be joined by Pivotal customers and partners for this not-to-miss event. 

In the coming weeks Pivotal will make available on-demand replays of my opening remarks, customer case studies and technology workshop sessions on our website. In the meantime, please join me &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/theplatform&gt; on November 12 to see what&apos;s next for Pivotal.
 
Best Regards,

Paul Maritz
