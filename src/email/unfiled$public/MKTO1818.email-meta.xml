Product Update
 New Release Lifecycle Definitions for Beta, GA, and GA but on Controlled Availability (CA) will apply for all the Pivotal new releases and products. To read more about these changes and the definitions, please consult the PRIME website &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/pivotal-prime-process/release-definitions&gt;. Questions? Please contact Corinne Lewy or Dave Mareiro at product_ops@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:product_ops@pivotal.io&gt;. 
 
 Alpine Update. We strongly believe in the value of Chorus and our partner Alpine and the synergies with Pivotal BDS portfolio. That said, the commercial structure of the OEM agreement we currently have in place with Alpine is not fully aligned with our joint value proposition to our customers. With that in mind, we expect this commercial structure to change starting 2015. We expect a &apos;sell with&apos; model where we &apos;co-sell&apos; Alpine products together with Pivotal Products.
 
 If you have key opportunities currently in flight that involve reselling Alpine, please follow the controlled availability process so Data Product Management may qualify the 
opportunity. Detail on controlled availability products may be found on the MPL &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/spreadsheets/d/1tfFpOi4NTyISBeQFI4S8WHnIAjddGxQ3goN5Z-Kc-3Q/edit#gid=574084898&gt; and FAQ &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/document/d/1lomgyj1z0J0-sC8eiFZOjOBpBCSYYb0J_K53z_dI8JM/edit&gt;. Please contact Sai Devulapalli &lt;mailto:sdevulapalli@pivotal.io&gt; for questions regarding our relationship with Chorus and Alpine.
 
 DCA - Hardware and Software Un-bundling 
 Starting November 10, new DCA hardware-only SKUs will available in DxP as an alternative to the existing consolidated single DCA SKUs. These new SKUs will enable a clean-cut between hardware and software for our customer base and help Pivotal focus on maximizing our attach with DCA along with streamlining 
attaching Big Data Suite to this popular appliance form factor. 

For the remainder of Q4, please proceed with business as usual: You will be able to continue to use the existing all-in appliance pricing and you will not be requested to shift to the new un-bundled pricing. If you have a specific opportunity that you&apos;d like to leverage the split SKU&apos;s with, please notify product marketing and sales operations.

Starting January 2015 however, all net-new DCA sales will have to follow the new pricing approach and you will be required to sell the Big 
Data Suite along with the DCA HW SKUs. Expansions and upgrades of existing DCA customers will be handled on a case by case basis, with a bias toward attaching Big Data Suite moving forward.

A FAQ will be available next Monday, 11/10 with complete details. Along with that, specific sales recommendations for common DCA sales situations will be provided.

In the meantime, should you have additional questions, please contact data-prod-marketing@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:data-prod-marketing@pivotal.io&gt;

 New Critical Referred Partner Services For Pivotal CF - DataStax and CloudBees
 We wanted to provide further details around two new exciting reseller relationships 
providing two new popular services on Pivotal CF, DataStax Enterprise for Cassandra and CloudBees Jenkins Enterprise. These services will provide added differentiation for Pivotal CF and may be critical to your prospect&apos;s use cases, so be sure to position them. Both are available through free-of-charge PivNet downloads to customers today and, in both cases, customers choosing to purchase these services need to engage with our reseller partners directly to transact. Pivotal is providing only level 1 support, ensuring the service is available and deployed with heartbeats; all level 2 and above support is provided by our partners directly.


 - DataStax Enterprise for Pivotal CF provides their commercial version of the popular OSS Cassandra database service for application developers. It is currently intended for test and development use cases through a multi-tenant implementation. Find links to supporting materials here &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal-cf/services?pli=1&gt;. 
 - CloudBees Jenkins Enterprise for Pivotal CF provides a 30-day free trial of their commercial version of the OSS Jenkins continuous integration platform for application developers. CloudBees provides proprietary plug-ins in addition to enterprise support services in this distribution. In order to be used beyond the 30-day trial, it must be purchased and fully licensed between your customer and CloudBees directly. Find links to supporting materials here &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal-cf/services?pli=1&gt;.
