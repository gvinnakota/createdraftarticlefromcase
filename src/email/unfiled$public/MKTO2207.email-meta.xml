Introducing Spring Session
HTTPSession data is an important part of any web facing application, and has been for a long time. Why not take a fresh, more portable look at it? Our Spring Security project lead Rob Winch thought it was time. This hot new Spring tech separates HTTPSession management from the container, and provides an API and implementation to do so. As you would expect, it can replace the HTTPSession object in a lightweight container like Apache Tomcat or Spring Boot, and then cluster it. Also, it’s built with REST and Websocket in mind – and leverages the extremely popular redis cache for its implementation. Head over to the project page &lt;http://projects.spring.io/spring-session/&gt; to check it out, and please, give us feedback!

Using Spring Session along with Spring Security
This tip describes how to use Spring Session along with Spring Security. It assumes you have already applied Spring Security to your application. First you must update your dependencies, then configure Spring with a servlet filter, and lastly, initialize the servlet container correctly. Details on these steps can be found in the Spring Session documentation here &lt;http://docs.spring.io/spring-session/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/html5/guides/security.html&gt;.
Code completion support in Eclipse
Code completion support in Eclipse and the Spring Tool Suite is aware of the camel case shortcuts. You don’t need to write NullPointerException, for example. It is enough to type in NPE and hit code completion to let it propose the right class name. This also works with lower case characters in between, so typing on “NuPoiEx” will also trigger the code completion to propose NullPointerException as class name.
Documenting RESTful APIs
Speaker: Andy Wilkinson

An API&apos;s documentation is a vital part of making it easy to understand and easy to use. RESTful APIs are no different. In this webinar we&apos;ll look at what should be included in your RESTful API&apos;s documentation and, just as importantly, what should be omitted. To illustrate this we&apos;ll look at some real-world examples of good and bad API documentation. 

We&apos;ll look at some of the problems and limitations of choosing a tool like Swagger to produce your API&apos;s documentation and conclude by looking at some alternatives that are better-suited to producing documentation that your users will love.

Spring XD: A Platform for data at scale and developer productivity
Speaker: Sabby Anandan

Worried about Big Data and the challenges inherent in making a real application? You don’t have to worry anymore! Spring XD provides a one-stop shop solution that spans traditional enterprise to Big Data use cases - both batch and streaming. It&apos;s important to choose the right tool for each use-case, which is why Spring XD integrates with technologies such as Spark, Reactor and RxJava to demonstrate the flexibility and the unified programming model to support complex data computation use-cases.

In this webinar, we&apos;ll show you how to develop data-driven use cases much faster than other big data solutions on the out of the box XD runtime.

Introducing Spring Session
Speaker: Josh Long

Back in the era of the application server, HTTP Session replication was a common way to scale out user session data, as well as make it fault tolerant. In today&apos;s world of lightweight containers, PaaS, and virtualization, Spring Session offers a 100% server and/or container portable HTTP Session.

See how Spring Session easily plugs in implementations like Redis, scales out across a cluster, handles multiple users&apos; browser sessions, works with WebSocket, and allows header based authentication within REST apps. It&apos;s a perfect fit for working with user data, particularly in a highly distributed environment like the cloud, or on a Platform like Cloud Foundry.
