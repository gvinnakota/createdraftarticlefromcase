Pivotal’s Partner Academy team is pleased to announce the release of Pivotal’s Associate Accreditation Program. Within the Program we have established a variety of Accreditation Paths, designed with consistent, clearly defined objectives and learning pathways. Our overarching goal of the program is to provide partners with a platform that enhances their capabilities around positioning, selling and delivering Pivotal based solutions.

These Accreditation Paths are designed to provide students with a strong foundational understanding of Pivotal products and are segmented by role and technology. Upon completion of the Pivotal Associate accreditation requirements, the student will have earned a corresponding badge.  
 
The initial list of Associate Accreditation options is as follows:

Technical Associate Accreditations: 


 - Technical Data Suite Associate: Greenplum Database
 - Technical Data Suite Associate: Gemfire
 - Technical Data Suite Associate: Gemfire XD
 - Technical PaaS Suite Associate: Pivotal CF
 - Technical App Suite Associate: Redis



Sales Associate Accreditations:


 - Sales Data Suite Associate
 - Sales PaaS Suite Associate
 - Sales App Suite Associate



In the near future we will be launching additional Associate Accreditations for Pivotal HD and HAWQ. 

Accreditation Badges
 
 Accreditation badges are easy to understand and keep track of within the Pivotal Academy For Partners. Once you log into the system, be sure to check the ‘Challenges’ section of your dashboard. Within this section of the Academy, you will easily be able to choose the Path that is right for you. Each Path has an estimated time investment between 3 to 8 hours depending upon the Accreditation selected.   

Upon completion of a Path’s requirements, successful students will earn Rewards. These Rewards will have a corresponding badge that is seen in the ‘Rewards’ section.

Courseware

These courses are available online, are modular in format and designed for self-paced study. All Associate Accreditation courses are available at no cost to the student. Our goal is simple – we want to make enablement easy for our Partners, to help make them successful.
