    <subject>2nd Half Compensation Update: PCF Bonus &amp; SPIF Renewals</subject>
    <textOnly>New Pivotal Cloud Foundry SPIF
PCF is an exciting product for Pivotal. It is clear that the market timing is good and customers are receptive. It is time to drive footprint! With that said, we are pleased to introduce more opportunities for bonus income above and beyond your target compensation. 

From July 1st through December 31st all Reps and FE individual contributors are eligible to both receive $7,500 USD on each new 1, 2 or 3 year PCF Subscription customer booking &gt;$250K per unique customer order. The SPIF will be paid after the fiscal year close. Only (1) Rep and (1) FE are eligible for the SPIF per customer order. 

PS@E and DCA SPIF have been renewed for 2H FY14. The same requirements will continue for the remainder of the year.
