VMware Specific Federation Engagement 

In the 2nd half of 2014 our go-to-market with VMware has taken a solid step toward deeper alignment. Carl Eschenbach, VMware COO and Pivotal board member, committed to a shared goal of 30 Pivotal CF logos sold through VMware. In order to support the attainment of this goal, Pivotal and VMware are implementing a teaming process with the objective of bringing structure and clarity to our joint selling motion. Details for this were introduced in the Focus Account FAQ &lt;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3CgGD1XdcmDNmxMbWdIb3g4d1k/edit?usp=sharing&gt; sent in the call to action on 8/4. In summary, the process involves joint account planning on accounts where we are committing to collaborate, and then leveraging a &apos;teaming agreement &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/file/d/0B9FiuJ_zSTJrT0t0cGdzcVViWi1qQWpndE02WUt5RC1wWmtr/edit&gt;&apos;, which is an account planning tool intended to identify and memorialize the activities that Pivotal and VMware teams will undertake as part of an agreed upon joint sales engagement plan. Below is the overall process you&apos;ll take with VMware field engagement. This will help to reduce concerns over committing time on joint opportunities and provide visibility to sales management.

 - Account plan - Pivotal and VMware reps complete an initial account planning call to determine account fit and set timeline to jointly qualify 
opportunity

 - Teaming agreement - download agreement here &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/file/d/0B9FiuJ_zSTJrT0t0cGdzcVViWi1qQWpndE02WUt5RC1wWmtr/edit&gt;
 - Document mutual steps to close in the teaming agreement with VMware counterpart

 - Send to vmware-teaming@pivotal.io and copy both Pivotal and VMware sales managers
 - Approval - teaming agreements will be reviewed and approved on biweekly Regional Director cadence calls
 - Go close the deal
