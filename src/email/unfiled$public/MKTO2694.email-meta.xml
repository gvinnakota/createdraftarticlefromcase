    <subject>Thank You for Joining Pivotal and the Spring Team at QCon London 2015</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=There}}, 

Did we meet you, or did you hear from us at QCon London &lt;http://www.qconlondon.com&gt;? We’re coming to conferences like QCon to specifically to help developers learn that cloud-native application architectures aren’t just available to pioneers like Netflix anymore - Spring and Cloud Foundry are making it accessible.  Grab a free copy of the 50 page concept primer from O&apos;Reilly - “Migrating to Cloud Native Application Architecture &lt;http://pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/migrating-to-cloud-native-application-architectures-ebook?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=qcon-london-q315&gt;”. 

If you weren&apos;t able to catch our talks, cool schwag, or technology, here’s a quick recap:


 - Dr. David Syer showed developers how Spring Boot makes using NetflixOSS in Spring simple in his talk:  “Microservices Made Easy with Spring Cloud and NetflixOSS”.

 - Familiar with Kubernetes or Mesos? Great! Download Lattice.cf &lt;http://lattice.cf&gt; today and get started with Spring Cloud via vagrant on your local machine or via AWS, using Cloud Foudry’s advanced “diego” 
scheduler, self-healing, http load balancer, and log aggregation.



If NetflixOSS gets you excited about the future, make sure to learn more now:
