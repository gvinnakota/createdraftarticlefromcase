    <subject>Webinars: Spring Boot, Hadoop Series and WebSocket Browser Apps with Spring</subject>
    <textOnly>Simplifying Spring with Spring Boot
Are you fed up with searching stackoverflow for copy-paste configuration, do you want to write apps that can &apos;just run&apos;. Perhaps you are just starting out with Spring and want a quick way to learn the basics without manually downloading and installing half the Internet?

In this webinar Phil Webb will demonstrate how Spring Boot can take you from zero to Spring with minimal fuss. We will look at how you can rapidly prototype Spring applications using Groovy, and how Spring Configuration in Java applications can be radically simpler. We will show how you can embed tomcat into your applications and turn a few lines of Java into a production ready, executable jar that is less the 8 Mb.

Building Big Data Apps with Hadoop &amp; Spring
At Pivotal we are bringing two open source projects together -- Hadoop and the very rapid and widely used Spring java application development framework to help build Big Data Applications.
While Hadoop is proving to be the defacto foundation for storing and processing data, real-world scenarios require much more. Millions of developers are already using Spring to create high performing, easily testable, reusable code without any lock-in.

In this month&apos;s webinar James Williams will explore how Spring XD (Xtreme Data) is addressing Big Data Application needs including: 

 - High throughput distributed data ingestion into HDFS from a variety of input sources;
 - Real-time analytics at ingestion time, e.g. gathering metrics and counting values;
 - Hadoop workflow management via batch jobs;
 - High throughput data export, e.g. from HDFS to a RDBMS or NoSQL database.

Building WebSocket Browser Applications with Spring
Join Rossen Stoyanchev to discuss Spring Framework 4.0 support for WebSocket, SockJS, and STOMP-based message brokering.  If you&apos;re used to web applications (and Spring MVC annotated controllers) you are familiar with the foundation that HTTP provides including URLs (nouns), HTTP methods (verbs), headers, parameters, and others. Imagine building an application without HTTP, just a socket. 

WebSocket gives you this brand new, exciting capability -- full duplex, two-way communication -- yet you no longer have an application-level protocol. Can an entire application be built around a single Endpoint class processing all messages, assuming a single WebSocket connection between browser and server? Thankfully the WebSocket protocol has a built-in sub-protocol mechanism.  

If you need to build a real-world application - whatever message format you choose, proprietary or standard, both client and server need to understand it as well as distinguish  different kinds of messages. You need support for the publish-subscribe pattern central to messaging applications so you can broadcast messages to one or more subscribers. You need to incorporate security, validation, and so on.
