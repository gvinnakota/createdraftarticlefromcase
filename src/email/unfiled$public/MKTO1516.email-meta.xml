    <subject>Spring Webinars: Microservices + PaaS, Spring Boot and JRebel 6.0 and Using Reactor for synch/non-blocking micro services</subject>
    <textOnly>Made for Each Other: Microservices + PaaS
Speakers: Donnie Berkholz IT Industry Analyst, RedMonk and Matt Stine Cloud Foundry Platform Engineer, Pivotal 

 Companies need to build better software faster to compete. But existing monolithic applications, legacy platforms, and lengthy operational deployment cycles are holding innovation back. Microservices are becoming the cloud architecture of choice because they offer the ability to loosely couple applications into discrete services that can be surgically changed without requiring disruptive overhauls. This approach enables the responsiveness needed by the business. Enterprise PaaS is a critical foundation to simplify the operations, governance, and health management of these new architectures. Together with a DevOps culture, microservices and PaaS are the engine that drives innovation at speed.

Spring Boot and JRebel 6.0
Speakers: Josh Long, Pivotal and Adam Koblentz, ZeroTurnaround 
 
Spring Boot, the new convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring&apos;s flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development not just fly, but pleasant! Spring Boot gives you a huge leg up over normal starter projects, now let&apos;s give you another boost by adding JRebel. With JRebel, the average Java developer saves over 1 work-month per year by using JRebel to skip rebuild, restart, and redeploys of their application. 

JRebel 6 was just launched and now includes complete Spring Boot integration. Join Spring&apos;s Josh Long and ZeroTurnaround&apos;s Adam Koblentz and learn how to combine Boot with JRebel and get more done, in less time with less configuration.

Using Reactor for asych/non-blocking microservices
Speaker: Stephane Maldini 

 What is the role of asynchronous, non-blocking style-communication in microservices? Join Stephane Maldini for a revealing look at why reactive components are so important in an eventually-consistent approach like microservice architecture. When services own their data and are completely independent, having a (reactive) abstraction layer can perform a variety of roles. Being able to parallelize resources a microservice owns is an important technique. Another might be as an event bus, pulling state data from various micro services dynamically, checking against the cached, fairly up-to-date local copy. 
 
 While a microservice has “all” the data it needs from other services to respond to a request, this data is not necessarily up-to-date—an important constraint to be prepared to accept. Stephane will also discuss other async use cases outside of microservices and how www.reactive-streams.org protocol support allows levels of portability across vendor implementations.
