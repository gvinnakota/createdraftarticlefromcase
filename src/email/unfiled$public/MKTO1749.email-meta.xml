    <subject>Introducing Pivotal People Source</subject>
    <textOnly>Happy New Year!

In the year end newsletter &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/newsletters/pivotal-newsletter-december-18-2014#people-update&gt;, I mentioned steps are being taken to improve and hopefully simplify our current systems by introducing new tools for employees in an effort 
to make information more accessible. While we inherited many disparate systems and still have much work to do, I am pleased to announce today that we are making a meaningful step forward with a new application called People Source, powered by SuccessFactors.

People Source is a new web-based application available to all employees at Pivotal, via our Applications homepage (aka, Okta).

Functionality within this application includes:
 - Company Directory, Org Chart, and Public Profile: Available to all employees to access each others’ contact information.

 - Personal Private Profile: Available to you, your manager, and HR to view job related information; such as pay, job title, equity history, etc.

 -  Goal Setting Tools: Leveraged by employees and managers to set goals throughout the year (as appropriate based on your organization’s approach).
 - Compensation Tools: Leveraged by management to plan employee bonus payouts, salary reviews, and equity allocations.

To access People Source, log into your Applications homepage (Okta) and select the People Source icon. Please click here &lt;https://drive.google.com/a/pivotal.io/file/d/0BwtWxkOn13C0OTI1OFdxbTRScmc/view?usp=sharing&gt; for a cheat sheet developed to help you navigate the tool, and please refer to the FAQ’s  &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/document/d/1XPWTEPZgaq4eDTRgECGxb2XARP74iYBKBhzeY8g1TTc/edit&gt;for more details.

What Remains the Same?

 - Benefits Site – Continue to leverage the current Benefits website &lt;https://secure.peoplelinkbenefits.com/emc/home.aspx&gt;. Pivotal specific benefits can be located here &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/departments/human-resources&gt;. 
 - Pivotal Payroll and Time Tracking – Payroll will not be changing. Employees should continue to use AskPayroll@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:AskPayroll@Pivotal.io&gt; for payroll related questions. 
 - AskHR – Continue to leverage AskHR@ to update your personal information (e.g., home address and work location).
 - EMC’s Employee Profile (Behind EMC Firewall) – EMC’s version of Employee Profile will continue to be in place, however, Pivotal employees should now leverage the Employee Profile in People Source.


Please stay tuned for further information regarding particular bonus and compensation programs, as well as additional functionality “coming soon” with this new app. For any questions or comments related to People Source, please reach out to AskHR@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:AskHR@pivotal.io&gt;. 

Best,
