    <subject>Important Reminder - The Cutover to Pivotal.io</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello Everyone,

The weekend of our cutover is almost here! This is the final reminder that we will be cutting over to the new Pivotal.io Google Apps instances over the weekend. 

The switchover will start at 5 p.m. (PDT) Friday, July 25, and should conclude by Sunday night. During this time, we will be migrating the last of your Emails, Calendars, Sites and Drive content. If you need a refresher, you can review the communications that went out earlier this month from Joe Militello and myself on Inside Pivotal on the Pivotal IO transition &lt;https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fsites.google.com%2Fa%2Fgopivotal.com%2Finside-pivotal%2Fpivotal-io%3Fpli%3D1%23top&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzy-5nrjyCbNrZx5yPymghRl1KwQ&gt; webpage. There you’ll find detailed FAQ’s and helpful links (including the new and public “Pivotal IO Transition Socialcast group &lt;https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgopivotal-com.socialcast.com%2Fgroups%2F108965-pivotaliotransition&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE0XtcC0zpnycq_dJiOsEiD4D8i9A&gt;, where you can discuss 
the transition with peers).

Important Do’s and Dont’s (from 5 p.m. Friday, PDT, through the weekend)


 - Please do not make any changes after 5 p.m. Friday (PDT) to your gopivotal.com or pivotallabs.com instances of: Sites, Drive, Calendar or Gmail, or the final delta migration may not fully sync for you. 

 - If you have forwarding turned on from your gopivotal.com email to your pivotallabs.com email or vice-versa, turn it off to avoid getting duplicate emails. Instructions can be found here &lt;https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fsites.google.com%2Fa%2Fgopivotal.com%2Fpivotal-it%2Fhow-to-pages%2Fenable-or-disable-email-forwarding%23TOC-Stop-auto-forwarding&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHXz-KhRbpniHhxlS8mXQd4YoIKyg&gt;. 

 - Review the FAQ on Inside Pivotal, and make time to review the post-migration Tips and Tricks on the Pivotal IT wiki page &lt;https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fsites.google.com%2Fa%2Fgopivotal.com%2Fpivotal-it%2F%3Fpli%3D1&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-hraXO6P07WB65bWGv8iof14Uhg&gt; (this covers items such as connecting your iPhone and Android devices to new emails; setting up export/imports for your mail filters; setting up “Out of Office” responses on old email accounts, etc.)


Conference Rooms and Being a Good Citizen

One challenge in the first few of days which you can all help make easier by following a few practices, will be re-scheduling conference rooms. While all of your all calendar/meeting entries will be migrated to the new .io instance, rooms associated with any meetings will not migrate. Please re-book all conference rooms again in the new .io calendar. Users should update meetings, especially recurring appointments, as soon as possible to reclaim the same conference room. 

Be a good citizen here. Make every attempt to book the same rooms you had in your old pivotallabs and gopivotal calendars. Before booking rooms in the new calendar, we recommend you check your old calendar on pivotallabs.com or gopivotal.com to reference booked rooms (you will still have access to your old calendars for two weeks, as a reference point only - do not book meetings in the old instance). The IT section in the FAQ &lt;https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fsites.google.com%2Fa%2Fgopivotal.com%2Finside-pivotal%2Fpivotal-io%3Fpli%3D1%23it&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEB83LNn3fZ90FHr0LrOaSHUxTU_A&gt; covers this and other automatic updates and required actions, at length.

Finally, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at ask@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:ask@pivotal.io&gt; with any questions not covered in the FAQ or Pivotal IT wiki page.
