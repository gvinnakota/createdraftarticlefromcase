    <subject>EMC World - A Pivotal Thanks</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Thank you for visiting Pivotal during EMC World! We were excited to showcase our technology, at the nexus of PaaS, Big Data and Agile software development for you.

 For more information about the solutions we demonstrated, please go to: Pivotal Big Data Suite &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/big-data/pivotal-big-data-suite&gt;, Business Data Lake, Pivotal CF &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/platform-as-a-service/pivotal-cf&gt;, Pivotal HD &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/big-data/pivotal-hd&gt; &amp; HAWQ. &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/sites/default/files/Hawq_WP_042313_FINAL.pdf&gt;

Pivotal is proud to be part of the EMC Federation &lt;http://emcfederation.com/&gt; of companies and EMC World was the premier event for IT and business professionals to meet and collaborate around EMC 
technologies. Certainly, all the hands-on product demos, technical sessions, and networking made coming all the way to Las Vegas worth it.
