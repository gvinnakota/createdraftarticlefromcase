    <subject>Thank You for Joining Pivotal and the Spring Team at Devoxx Poland 2015</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=There}}, 

Did we meet you, or did you hear from us at Devoxx Poland &lt;http://www.devoxx.pl&gt;? We’re coming to conferences like Devoxx to specifically to help developers learn that cloud-native application architectures aren’t just available to pioneers like Netflix anymore - Spring and Cloud Foundry are making it accessible.  Grab a free copy of the 50 page concept primer from O&apos;Reilly - “Migrating to Cloud Native Application Architecture &lt;http://pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/migrating-to-cloud-native-application-architectures-ebook?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=devoxx-poland-q315&gt;”. 

If you weren&apos;t able to catch our talks, cool schwag, or technology, here’s a quick recap:


 - Juergen Hoeller gave a well attended talk on Modern Java Component Design with Spring Framework 4.2, and also showed us what’s coming in future releases in a separate roadmap short talk, and an evening BOF.
 - Josh Long showed developers how NetFlixOSS components are being integrated into the Spring programming model with “Bootiful” microservices with Spring Cloud”.
 - Josh Long showed us the container at base of the microservice stack, Spring Boot in his talk “Bootiful Applications with Spring Boot”
 - Pieter Humphrey explained how to Deploy Microservice Architectures with Spring Cloud on Cloud Foundry, discussing how NetflixOSS is integrated to both the Spring programming model as well as Pivotal Cloud Foundry.
 - Thomas Darimont from the Spring Data project gave a whirlwind tour of what’s new recent releases like “Fowler” and a peek at the upcoming “Gosling” release.

 - Familiar with Kubernetes or Mesos? Great! Download Lattice.cf &lt;http://lattice.cf&gt; today and get started with Spring Cloud via vagrant on your local machine or via AWS, using Cloud Foudry’s advanced “diego” 
scheduler, self-healing, http load balancer, and log aggregation.
