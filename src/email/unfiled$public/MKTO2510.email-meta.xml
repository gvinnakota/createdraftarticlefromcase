    <name>Pivotal IT Comm.SSO Rollout</name>
    <style>none</style>
    <subject>ACTION REQUIRED: New Pivotal SSO - Set up your account</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello to all Pivotal employees!
We&apos;re excited to tell you about a change that&apos;s been in the works for several months - we&apos;re upgrading our Single Sign-On provider from the old and busted Lighthouse to the new hotness, Okta.  For you, work.gopivotal.com &lt;http://work.gopivotal.com/&gt; will become a single place to access all your work apps: it will look different, but your Pivotal Google account will stay the same.  For IT, it&apos;s a major improvement that will allow us to support Pivotal better in getting new people access to their accounts, and assisting people when they need help.
There are more details about our SSO roadmap and Okta on the Pivotal IT wiki &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/pivotal-it/pivotal-single-sign-on&gt;.
What&apos;s changing?


 - New sign in page at the same address: work.gopivotal.com &lt;http://work.gopivotal.com/&gt;
 - Okta Dashboard: One sign-in, many apps.  We&apos;re starting with Google Apps, SocialCast, and Concur, but we&apos;re going to add more over time.
 - We&apos;re adding Multi-factor authentication &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/pivotal-it/pivotal-single-sign-on/multi-factor-authentication&gt;: Better security for your account to give you (and our Information Security team) peace of mind.


What you need to do by 6pm PT, Friday, March 21


 - Later today, Pivotal IT will send you an activation email at your gopivotal.com &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/&gt; address.  Click the Activation Link in the body of the email to set up your Pivotal Okta account.  Detailed instructions are on the Pivotal IT wiki &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/pivotal-it/pivotal-single-sign-on&gt;.
 - Because Google will now use Okta to sign you into your gopivotal.com &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/&gt; account, you must set up your Okta account before 6pm PT, March 21, 2014.  If you haven&apos;t set up your account by then, you may be locked out of your accounts.


Google Service Disruption During the Change


 - It&apos;s tough to change the wheels on a moving vehicle, so we&apos;ll need to shut down work.gopivotal.com &lt;http://work.gopivotal.com/&gt; (and access to Google Apps) starting at 6pm PT Friday, March 21.
 - Service should be restored by 10am PT Saturday, March 22, but there may be some additional brief downtime for the rest of the weekend.
 - Managers: If you have people out on vacation who won&apos;t be able to create their Okta accounts before the cutover, please reach out to askIT@gopivotal.com &lt;mailto:askIT@gopivotal.com&gt; as soon as they&apos;re back.  The IT team will work with you and your reports to set up their Okta access.
 - After the cutover date, you may need to update your passwords on mobile devices.  Your Google Apps password will be the same as your Okta password.


If you have any questions about this change, you can email askIT@gopivotal.com &lt;mailto:askIT@gopivotal.com&gt; from any email address.
 
Regards,
