    <subject>Second Day - Pivotal Cloud Platform Roadshow Cork</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Thank you for registering to attend the Pivotal Cloud Platform Roadshow in Cork.

Due to overwhelming interest in the event, we have decided to add a second date. As the Federation (EMC, VMWare, Pivotal &amp; VCE) was the largest group to register, we are opening a dedicated Roadshow for Federation members which will take place on Friday, December 5th. If you are part of the Federation, you must attend this date. The event on the 5th will be held in the learning and development centre and closer to the day, we will send a follow up mail with directions and parking details.


We would like to thank you for your support in making this event a success and hope you understand the reason for moving you to the second day. If you have any queries please e-mail Trevor Kenna &lt;mailto:tkenna@pivotal.io&gt;.

 
Thanks,
The 
Pivotal Team</textOnly>
