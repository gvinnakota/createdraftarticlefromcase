    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

I’m on the Pivotal team that supports {{company.Company Name:default=enterprise companies}} and was curious if you had any challenges linking existing storage systems with your Hadoop HDFS? 

Because this is a common challenge for our customers, I wanted to invite you to a webinar &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/big-data/hadoop/querying-external-data-sources-with-hadoop-webinar&gt; that will introduce how Pivotal can help you leverage your existing data infrastructure investments with HDFS.

Querying External Data Sources with Hadoop - Tuesday, 7/15 @ 9AM PDT.
Register today &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/big-data/hadoop/querying-external-data-sources-with-hadoop-webinar&gt; for this technical preview on how to add extensibility into Hadoop.

If you’re not able to make the webinar but just have some questions please shoot me a line I’ll do my best to help.
