    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Thank you for your interest in our Driving Real Insights Through Data Lakes &lt;http://pivotal.io/event/driving-real-insights-through-data-lakes/bridgewater&gt; event.

We are currently updating the agenda and adding new speakers. In order to accommodate these changes, we have decided to postpone this event to a little later in the Fall.

When the new date is determined, you will receive another email with the details and additional information. We appreciate your interest and look forward to seeing you soon.

Thanks,
The Pivotal Team</textOnly>
