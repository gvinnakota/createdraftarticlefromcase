As a global company, we thought it was time to open our doors to the great city of London. Located in the heart of Tech City &lt;http://www.techcityuk.com/#!/home&gt;, Pivotal UK is committed to the growth and development of Europe&apos;s fastest-growing innovation hub. 


As a valued friend of Pivotal, the company at the intersection of big data &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/big-data&gt;, PaaS &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/paas&gt;, and agile development &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/agile&gt;, we invite you to an intimate gathering of UK tech leaders at our new office on Old Street. Afterwards head to our larger celebration nearby at McQueen in Shoreditch, or you can meet us there. Transportation will be provided from the office. 
 
Please join us for an evening of fun drinks, tasty bites, and celebration. Please RSVP below by February 28th to secure your spot.
