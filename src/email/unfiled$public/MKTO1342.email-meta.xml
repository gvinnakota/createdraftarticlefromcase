    <subject>Pivotal Club and Bonus Opportunities Expand!</subject>
    <textOnly>Team:

With great products and focus we’ve set the bar high in what we expect from this high-performance field team. We have big targets in the 2H, and a goal to build the kind of pipeline that will propel us into an ambitious 2015.
As we close out Q3 and enter the final quarter, we’re creating more paths for you to achieve top recognition and rewards as you drive this business forward and achieve your targets. 

Expanding Pivotal Club and Bonuses 

I hope 
you’re as excited as I am about the FY14 Pivotal Club, at the Ritz Carlton in Maui &lt;http://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/Properties/KapaluaMaui/Default.htm&gt;. I’m pleased to announce that we’ve increased the number of sales representatives and field engineers who will be invited to attend Pivotal Club! While we’ve expanded the number of seats, not everyone who is eligible for Pivotal Club can be invited to attend. But everyone who is eligible will be rewarded this year. 

We’re giving quota-carrying sales representatives and field engineers more opportunities to earn a Club invitation or a special bonus by expanding 
the “100% Bonus” target that determines your eligibility for either one. Here’s how it works: 


 - Priority invitations for Pivotal Club go first to those who meet full-year targets, and then to those who meet 2H targets, with selections based on sales rankings. However, those eligible sales representatives who do not receive a Club invitation will receive a new “100% Bonus” reward.




 - The new 100% Bonus is a $5,000 payout for eligible sales representatives who meet either their full-year or 2H sales quota. If you were hired in the 2H before 9/30/2014 or you missed in the 1H, you have have a shot at this reward.
 - This applies to Field Engineers: More of you will be invited to attend Club, and more of you will receive a $5,000 bonus, based on Global Field Operations making our numbers.
