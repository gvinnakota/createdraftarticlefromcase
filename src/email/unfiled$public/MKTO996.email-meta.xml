    <subject>Important Update: Booking Travel</subject>
    <textOnly>All,

As many of you may know, Pivotal shares EMC’s Travel and Expense program management systems (Concur and Amex).

Effective Monday, August 18th, EMC will require a new travel pre-approval process for all trips, in advance of booking. Pivotal has opted out of this requirement, and our employees will not require travel pre-approval.

IMPORTANT: When 
prompted for the new “pre-trip Authorization ID” in Concur (or when talking to an Amex booking agent), Pivotal employees must now simply enter or provide the code &quot;pivotal&quot; in order to opt out. You must do this to proceed with your reservation, without a pre-approval code.  

While we are not part of this EMC procedure, please continue to follow the same protocols with your managers and exercise the same good judgement on costs when booking your travel 
arrangements.

Please contact Mike LeBlanc &lt;mailto:mleblanc@pivotal.io&gt; or ask@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:ask@pivotal.io&gt; if you have any questions.



 
Regards,
Robert O’Donovan
CFO, Pivotal
