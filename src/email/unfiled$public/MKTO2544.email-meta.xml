    <subject>EMC Announces Definitive Agreement to Acquire Virtustream</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Colleagues,

Earlier today EMC announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately-held Virtustream. Virtustream provides managed private cloud solutions and is highly respected (a leader in their Gartner quadrant) and has built a fast growing business managing and hosting key enterprise applications such as SAP. This acquisition is designed to complement other Federation private and hybrid cloud capabilities such as EMC’s Enterprise Hybrid Cloud solution and vCloud Air from VMware. 

Over the next few months there will be announcements on complementary next steps as Virtustream becomes part of the EMC Federation. We expect an example of such a complementary step to be leveraging Virtustream’s experience as a possible partner in offering managed versions of Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data Suite. 

The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2015, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory clearance. In the meanwhile, please welcome Virtustream, but also please don’t overwhelm them until they are firmly on board.

For more information, please see the blogs by Howard Elias of EMC &lt;https://reflectionsblog.emc.com/2015/05/how-would-you-like-your-cloud/&gt; and the CEO of Virtustream &lt;http://www.virtustream.com/blog/2015/05/26/EMCNews/&gt;.</textOnly>
