    <subject>Final Reminder: Please Complete Your Q3 Accreditation</subject>
    <textOnly>Team, 

 The deadline for completing the Q3 Field Accreditation (August 15th) has passed, and we still have several people on our Field team who need to finish their courses and quizzes - 
and we know who you are :-). This training provides key information on how to pursue and position Big Data Suite and Pivotal CF opportunities, all of which will help drive a great 2H. 

 Please take the time to finish any outstanding courses by August 31st, so you can stay focused on closing business in September. 

 If the latest Accreditation completion report (sent 27 August to your manager) seems inaccurate or incomplete, please send an email directly to academy@pivotaledu.zendesk.com, and ask that they verify your completions in the database. 

 If you still need to complete a course:


 - Log on to the Field Enablement &lt;http://pivotal.biglms.com/field_enablement&gt; site on Pivotal Academy.
 - If you haven not registered yet, select “register” and complete that process.
 - If you have already registered, you may be asked for some additional detail upon logging in again, so that we can provide more detailed reports.  Please complete that before proceeding to your courses.
 - Select “Enablement Programs” → “Accreditation” → “Q3 2014” and finish any outstanding courses and quizzes.



I appreciate your efforts here. This all about getting better at articulating and accelerating the biggest drivers of our business. 

 Make it happen!</textOnly>
