    <subject>Update On Data - A Conversation with Hugh Williams and Scott Aronson</subject>
    <textOnly>Team, 

On the heels of a recent announcement with Hortonworks and the Hadoop Ambari project I have fielded a number of questions about our Hadoop strategy. I have also sensed some confusion regarding the company’s commitment to our data products and business.

Make no mistake: Data is instrumental to our our current and future business success and also puts us on a strong trajectory for growing the business with subscription 
services. We were fortunate to close out a very successful first half. This included coming in at 130% of our plan for the Big Data Suite since its Q2 launch.  

To provide some detail and insight on our data plans, Hugh and I recently sat down for a video &lt;https://drive.google.com/a/pivotal.io/file/d/0B8GCVlqTdMB-endwVENpdHYyeVU/edit?usp=sharing&gt; and 
covered a broad range of topics that we hope you find informative.

Hugh explains the pieces of our data business, and the strategy that ties them together. We also discuss how to apply this to our selling motions. Highlights include:

 


 - Our relationship with Hortonworks through the Ambari agreement, and what it means for the field
 - What’s next for GPDB, Gemfire, HAWQ, and Hadoop
 - How our Big Data Suite offer differentiates us from competitors, where product development is heading, and what to expect in the second half of 2014


Finally, I want to thank Hugh and his team for a huge effort in shaping a powerful and differentiated data portfolio. Hugh and I are both focused on driving a winning data story that meets the needs of our customers better than any other company in the market.

Action
Please do take 35 minutes to view this important video &lt;https://drive.google.com/a/pivotal.io/file/d/0B8GCVlqTdMB-endwVENpdHYyeVU/edit?usp=sharing&gt;. I’m planning to do more of these Q&amp;A sessions, so please let me know what you think. My door is open, and the executive staff is here to support you.

And speaking of differentiating ourselves in Hadoop, click here for a great blog post &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/big-data-pivotal/products/pivotal-hawq-benchmark-demonstrates-up-to-21x-faster-performance-on-hadoop-queries-than-sql-like-solutions&gt; and link to a SIGMOD conference white paper around HAWQ performance 
benchmarks!

Make it happen!</textOnly>
