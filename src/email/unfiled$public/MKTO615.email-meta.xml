    <subject>An Important Announcement from Pivotal IT</subject>
    <textOnly>To all Pivotal:
Pivotal IT is pleased to announce the general availability of the Pivotal VPN. This is a network service by Pivotal, for Pivotal, and is distinct from EMC or VMware VPN.
Pivotal’s VPN is an extension of Pivotal’s network out to all Pivots, regardless of where they may be, so they can pair and reach resources that may not be directly exposed to the internet.
The rollout of this service has begun with connection points in several key regions, and will continue to expand to more sites and regions over the next 60 days. VPN connection points are available now in:


 - Palo Alto
 - Durham (Pivotal network, NOT EMC)
 - Toronto
 - Las Vegas (cloud)
 - Sydney (cloud)


More sites in Asia and Europe are coming this month, so keep an eye on the  VPN Rollout Status page &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/pivotal-it/pivotal-vpn/vpn-rollout-status&gt; for ongoing updates.
To learn more, visit the Pivotal VPN page &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/pivotal-it/pivotal-vpn&gt; and we know some of you will have questions, so definitely check out the VPN FAQ &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/pivotal-it/pivotal-vpn/vpn-faq&gt; (we strongly recommend it).
If you have questions, head over to the Pivotal VPN Socialcast Group &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/groups/97619-pivotalvpn&gt; and as always if you run into any issues, just send mail to askit@gopivotal.com. &lt;mailto:askit@gopivotal.com&gt;
