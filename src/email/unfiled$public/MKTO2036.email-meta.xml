    <subject>Spring Webinars: Single-Page Apps with Spring Security, Angular JS and Polymer</subject>
    <textOnly>A Single-Page Application with Spring Security and Angular JS
Speaker: David Syer

Spring Security, Spring Boot and Angular JS all have nice features for making it really easy to produce modern applications, so there is potentially a lot of value in making them work together very smoothly. Things to consider are cookies, headers, native clients, various security vulnerabilities and how modern browser technology can help us to avoid them.

In this session we show how nice features of the component frameworks can be integrated simply to provide a pleasant and secure user experience. We start with a very basic single-server implementation and scale it up in stages, splitting out backend resources and authentication to separate services. The final state includes a simple API Gateway on the front end implemented declaratively using Spring Cloud, and using this we are able to neatly sidestep a lot of the problems people encounter securing a javascript front end with a distributed back end.

JHipster for Spring Boot
Speaker: Julien Dubois

JHipster focuses on generating a high quality application with a Java back-end using an extensive set of Spring technologies; Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data, Spring MVC (providing a framework for websockets, REST and MVC), etc. an Angular.js front-end and a suite of pre-configured development tools like Yeoman, Maven, Gradle, Grunt, Gulp.js and Bower. JHipster creates a fully configured Spring Boot application with a set of pre-defined screens for user management, monitoring, and logging. The generated Spring Boot application is specifically tailored to make working with Angular.js a smoother experience.

Join Julien for a quick-live coding session to build a simple application, and deploy it to Cloud Foundry.

Building a secure Polymer app with Spring backend
Speaker: Scott Deeg

Polymer is the latest web framework out of Google. Designed completely around the emerging Web Components standards, it has the lofty goal of making it easy to build apps based on these low level primitives. Along with Polymer comes a new set of Elements (buttons, dialog boxes and such) based on the ideas of &quot;Material Design&quot;. These technologies together make it easy to build responsive, componentized &quot;Single Page&quot; web applications that work for browsers on PCs or mobile devices. But what about the backend, and how do we make these apps secure?

In this talk Scott Deeg will take you through an introduction to Polmyer and its related technologies, and then through the build out of a full blown cloud based app with a secure, RESTful backend based on Spring REST, Spring Cloud, and Spring Security and using Thymeleaf for backend rendering jobs. At the end he will show the principles applied in a tool he&apos;s currently building. The talk will be mainly code walk through and demo, and assumes familiarity with Java/Spring and JavaScript.
