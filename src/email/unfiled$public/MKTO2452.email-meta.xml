    <subject>Thank You for Joining Pivotal at ApacheCon and Welcome Apache Geode!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Pivotal had a lot going on this year as a Platinum sponsor at ApacheCon. In addition to several excellent sessions, Pivotal also debuted Apache Geode &lt;http://pivotal.io/big-data/press-release/pivotal-releases-geode&gt; (now incubating) â€“ the new in-memory distributed database that will form the open source core of Pivotal GemFire &lt;http://pivotal.io/big-data/pivotal-gemfire&gt;.

Pivotal is looking for supporters for the Apache Geode technology and community. Check out this blog &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/big-data-pivotal/news-2/become-a-founding-contributor-of-project-geode&gt; for information on how to get involved.

For additional opportunities to support the effort:


 - Visit the Apache Geode page &lt;http://geode.incubator.apache.org/&gt;
 - Participate in the Apache Geode community &lt;http://geode.incubator.apache.org/community/&gt;
 - Learn how you can become a project contributor to this powerful in-memory, distributed database in this video &lt;http://bit.ly/POSH0068yt&gt;
 - Join this webinar &lt;http://connect.pivotal.io/OSS_Webinar_9AMPOSH_Handson_Virtual_Meetup_Apache_Geode1_GettingStarted_Register.html&gt; on June 2nd for a technical tutorial demonstrating how to use in-memory data grid technologies and add these capabilities to your applications
