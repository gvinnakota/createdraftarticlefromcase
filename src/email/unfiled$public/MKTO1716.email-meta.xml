    <subject>Field Organizational Update - Ready in 2015</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear All, 

We have closed the books on 2014, and what a year it’s been! In less than two years, our Field has placed the company on a healthy trajectory, with a strong pipeline to start off 2015.

If we look back at the Sales Kick Off last February, we can appreciate our 
achievements in light of what we asked of you: Moving hardware out of the business; Introducing new packaging for our software; Shifting from perpetual license to a subscription services model; Doubling Labs’ enterprise customer representation to 80% of our total Labs business. 

You executed flawlessly to hit our numbers - and it speaks volumes to the great capabilities of each and every one of you on this team. I thank you all for adapting, moving fast, and making it happen! 

I can get into more specifics once EMC reports its earnings, but can say now that we had tremendous momentum across the business. The market for data is being reinvigorated by the adoption of open source standards at the core, and a differentiating, holistic data stack. We’re at the forefront of SQL becoming what the IDC calls Hadoop’s “killer app in 2015”. The Big Data Suite will continue to be an integral leverage point for our business. Cloud Foundry has become the global standard for an open PaaS, giving us great leverage to bring Pivotal Cloud Foundry (Pivotal CF) to customers as their enterprise-grade, commercial PaaS. We logged wins with marquee brands that is propelling PaaS across enterprises. Labs has emerged as our secret weapon, with outstanding growth across the board, and a few big, game-changing deals that testify to the transformation we’re helping customers achieve. 

In 2015, we’ll continue down the path you’ve forged, as the company sharpens its focus on PaaS, Data, and Agile. We have worked on a 2015 financial interlock that was both bottoms-up and tops-down, resulting in a growth plan that is both manageable and achievable. Your hard work and successes have opened many doors, and as we reset the clock in 2015 with ambitious goals, we&apos;ve made organizational changes to execute against that strategy.  

First, and as previously announced, Russell Acton has accepted a role outside of Pivotal, while Greg Stroud stepped in to serve as interim EMEA 
sales lead. We thank Russell for his contributions to Pivotal, and I want to personally thank Greg for stepping in to help us cross the finish line for 2014. 

I’m delighted to announce Alan Coad as our new lead for EMEA sales, who officially joins us on January 5th. Alan was most recently the CEO of RockeTalk, Inc., a mobile social platform company, where he helped grow its user base to more than 20 million, while securing several rounds of funding. Prior to RockeTalk, Alan built a track record of success in running sizable organizations, including P&amp;L ownership, and managing successful change efforts. Please join me in welcoming Alan to the leadership team, and I look forward to working with him.

We’ve also made the following changes for 2015: 



 - John Jahnke, who led Field Engineering (FE), will transition to lead an Americas sales team working with Andy O’Brien. We thank John for his outstanding leadership in building a strong FE team and culture, and we’re delighted to have him on the sales bench, where his knowledge of our products and his deep customer relationships will help us continue to move the needle. 
 - As part of that transition, the FE leadership under John will now report directly into their respective geography and functional sales leaders. Todd Ulrich will continue to lead the FE team for the Americas working with Andy O’Brien; Peter Cooper will continue to lead the FE team for APJ working with Melissa Ries; and Les Klein will continue to lead the FE team for EMEA supporting Alan. Michael Wood will continue in his role working with Nick Cayou to lead the FE team for the Alliances.
 - Further, Austin Rutherford will transition to Todd Paoletti, focusing on Field Engineering Operations and Strategy. You’ll recall that Todd recently joined my team to oversee GTM alignment, Field Operations, Inside Sales, Product Operations, Partner Programs, Pricing and Enablement. 
 - Ian Andrews will transition to a new role supporting both Data and PaaS go-to-market field motions, reporting directly to me. This includes a new, Specialty Sales team for Data. As core sales teams fully embrace the Pivotal CF sales motions, we formed this Data team to provide extra support and coverage to ensure continued sales momentum. Their charter is to help drive the data pipeline and sales success, with a particular focus on the Americas. I’m confident that Ian’s customer acumen and strong relationships with product teams will help us accelerate our Data business. On the PaaS side, Josh McKenty joins this team, reporting into Ian as Field CTO for PaaS. 

 - We’ve expanded our Customer Success Organization under Iain Gray, to include dedicated architectural and technical teams for both pre and post sales for customers in PaaS and Data, focused on the 
Americas. Dino Cicciarelli continues to lead PaaS pre- and post-sales efforts, taking on the additional responsibility of technical account management within the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Practice group. Dino’s team will develop repeatable assets for the field and is equipped to go deep on architectures for our most strategic PaaS deals. For Data, we’ve created the Pivotal Data Engineering group, led by Jacque Istok which will have a similar charter in managing pre/post sales and technical account management. Both Dino and Jacque will ensure customer confidence and success through the post-sales software implementation. There are no changes to the existing service models for APJ and EMEA.


 - Throughout 2014, Amar Varma helped lead Labs’ customer rotation to the Enterprise, capping this off with $100M in Enterprise Labs bookings for 2014. With that rotation complete, Amar will join Leo Spiegel’s team in Corporate Strategy and Development to bring Pivotal’s Agile Enablement Process to the enterprise to drive customer transformation through the adoption of Pivotal products. He’ll also help reinvigorate Pivotal&apos;s position in the startup ecosystem and drive other global expansion initiatives.  


 - As a result, we’ve asked Alex Luttschyn to take responsibility, provide leadership and oversight over the Labs selling motion in pursuit of the bookings goals, inclusive of our 
strategies to ensure that we attach Pivotal Cloud Foundry to opportunities wherever possible. The Labs sales teams will become more integrated with our core sales teams in the field through a dual reporting structure. Alex has been a huge influence and has already been working with Amar in this capacity but will now report to me. We look forward to his continued leadership. 




I want to thank each and every one of you for your hard work, and say again that in a year of much change, you rose to the challenge time and again. I’d specifically like to call out our leadership in 2014 who brought us to this juncture, and who will continue to lead us in 2015: Andy O’Brien for his excellent leadership in Americas sales; Melissa Ries for her tireless efforts in APJ; Nick Cayou for continuing to stake out new territory in Alliances; and Iain Gray who joined us in 2014 and has stood up our Customer Success Organization.

2015 Selling Principles 

As we head into 2015, I ask you to think about and measure yourself against three key indicators - the “3 P’s”: Productivity, Pipeline, and Platform. Let’s be more productive by enabling team members to generate and close new opportunities. Second, let’s build a predictable, scalable business by having a strong and robust pipeline. And lastly, let’s ensure that our Labs engagements pull in platform sales. If we adhere to these principles, the sky&apos;s the limit!

Finally, whether you’re a sales representative, field engineer, or in customer support, you should not see a big change in your 
everyday role. As this field coalesces around our businesses, these changes will help us all execute an exceptional end-to-end customer experience.

I look forward to seeing you at the Sales Kick-Off in February, and I’m super excited for 2015 and confident in what we will continue to accomplish together.

Make it happen!</textOnly>
