A Message from Greg Stroud
DECEMBER 2014 SALES NEWS FLASH
Global Field Operations Team,

Please take the time to read our final communication for the year carefully; as there are a number of updates that you should be aware of.

Product Update

VRP: As part of the recent changes within Pivotal, we are adjusting and re-allocating engineering resource across the BDS product and engineering teams. One of those decisions is that effective immediately we will no longer be providing VRP to customers. Customers currently using VRP cannot expand the use of VRP in their environments. All evaluations and POCs must be pulled immediately. SKUs for VRP have been removed from the price list and will be removed shortly from the configurator. References to VRP will be removed from web and collateral associated shortly.

Pivotal services teams will be able to continue to leverage the VRP tool in combination with health-check services.  However, the product must be installed and operated by Pivotal services personnel only and uninstalled at the completion of the services engagement.  We will not take any support calls for the product from Pivotal resources for these health-check engagements.  

The VRP end of sales was also covered during this field call from last &lt;https://emccorp.webex.com/emccorp/ldr.php?RCID=e4cc2c587441f9c0bfd10f8b24ea2af5&gt; week.

SFDC What&apos;s New

Discount thresholds and non-approval requirements will remain unchanged. More information may be found on the Global Field Operations Inside Pivotal page, FAQ for Deal Desk
