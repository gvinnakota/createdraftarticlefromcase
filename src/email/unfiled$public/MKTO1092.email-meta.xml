Thank you for joining us for our customer webinar &quot;Enabling Personalized Healthcare with Biomedical Informatics&quot; last Wednesday, August 27, 2014 with Aridhia. We hope you found the session informative. 

Our webinar explored how Aridhia is using Pivotal technology to maximize the potential of existing data within the healthcare system, enabling healthcare providers to inform clinical outcomes from insights gained from complex datasets, and providing a data science safe haven that promotes collaboration between healthcare, academia and industry.
