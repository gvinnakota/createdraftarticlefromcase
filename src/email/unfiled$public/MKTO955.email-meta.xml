    <subject>IT Memo - What You Need to Know About Pivotal.io</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi Team,
Building on the announcement earlier from Joe Militello &lt;http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fplay.gopivotal.com%2Findex.php%2Femail%2FemailWebview%3Fmkt_tok%3D3RkMMJWWfF9wsRomrfCcI63Em2iQPJWpsrB0B%252FDC18kX3RUtJ7SWfkz6htBZF5s8TM3DV1BFXrlU6kEISrnTaIVT7tlYCkWbXGau2fKK&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFrqEze3Jn8jFTYt77o9NFe9zZxS9kQzzg&gt; around the launch of pivotal.io &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/pivotal-io&gt;, I’d like to provide an IT update with more details on what will happen automatically, and what you will need to do from 28 July onwards.
Aside from changes to the public website, the most visible change for employees will be to the Google Apps productivity suite: our tools for email, calendar, Sites, Drive, etc. For the past month, we’ve been migrating all of your content to the new pivotal.io &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/pivotal-io&gt; Google Apps instance. 
We’re planning a final delta migration on the weekend of July 26-27th, and we will need to lock the system down during this time period to ensure everything migrates successfully. We’ll ensure business continuity to the greatest degree that we can, and will communicate more details as we get closer to that weekend. The FAQ’s we have posted on the Pivotal.io landing page  &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/pivotal-io&gt;on Inside Pivotal will answer many questions, and below are some key highlights: 
What Will be in Place


 - Starting Monday, July 28th, you will access Google Apps the same way you always have, by logging into work.gopivotal.com &lt;work.gopivotal.com&gt; or the new URL work.pivotal.io &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/pivotal-io&gt; - both will take you to the same place. Once you’re logged into Okta successfully, you’ll see the new pivotal.io &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/pivotal-io&gt; Google Apps populated in your “My Applications” page within Okta, and you should start using these immediately on July 28th.




 - Please note that IT will provide Okta authorization to all employees and contractors who do not currently have it, a process which is underway now. 




 - We’re migrating your Google email, calendar, Drive and Sites details to the new pivotal.io &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/pivotal-io&gt; Google instance for you.  




 - For most, your email username from your gopivotal.com &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com&gt; accounts will remain the same in new instance (the new instance will follow a standard of first initial of your first name followed by your surname, then @pivotal.io &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/pivotal-io&gt;. For example, I will be ccurtis@pivotal.io). If your email address does not follow that standard, it will in most cases change for the migration to align with this standard. We’ll reach out separately to all of those with new email addresses to let them know what they will be.




 -  ask@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:ask@pivotal.io&gt; is the new email address to use to request help from IT or Facilities. That new e-mail address works now




 - All email sent to your former accounts will automatically be forwarded to your new email address.


Do’s and Dont’s  
 While your content will migrate over, you’ll need to take some actions in the new Google Apps domain in order to maintain the look and feel like they did within your old gopivotal.com or pivotallabs.com settings. This includes setting up your mobile devices with the new account information. Please refer to the IT section of the pivotal.io FAQ &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/pivotal-io&gt; document on Inside Pivotal for details on what you’ll need to know and do. Key items include:


 - You’ll be able to access your old accounts for a few weeks after July 28th. This will allow you to check and make sure your data has transferred correctly. However, you will not be able to send or receive emails from your old accounts after 28 July.




 - Please do not create any new calendar appointments, Drive documents, or new Sites from your old gopivotal.com or pivotallabs.com accounts after 5 p.m. PST on Friday, July 25th. We will not be able to sync any information after that date. 




 - EMC IT will update systems managed by EMC to use your new pivotal.io email address, and your EMC NT ID (CORP ID) and passwords will not change. The pivotal.io &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/pivotal-io&gt; FAQ also answers these and other questions related to your EMC and VMware accounts, as well as other applications and how they will be affected by this change.  




 - If you have a question that is not addressed in this note or the FAQ, please submit it to ask@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:ask@pivotal.io&gt;, the new way to request assistance. 


We’ll keep you posted on additional details as we get closer to the launch. 
 
Best,
