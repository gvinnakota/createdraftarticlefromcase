    <subject>A Pivotal CF Announcement</subject>
    <textOnly>Team - 

Today, in announcing the General Availability of Pivotal CF, Pivotal&apos;s first commercial release of Cloud Foundry and also delivering the first set of Pivotal One services (Pivotal HD, Pivotal AX, RabbitMQ, and MySQL) we hit a milestone in delivering on the Pivotal One vision. 

Pivotal CF, powered by Cloud Foundry, is the key enabler for achieving the modern, software driven organization. Purpose-built for continuous delivery and horizontal architectures, Cloud Foundry allows developers to focus on the application as the unit of deployment and scale, not infrastructure. It provides an abstraction layer that enables enterprises to make infrastructure choices based on price, performance, location and efficiency. It empowers businesses to deliver applications and update them with new features at a velocity and scale previously only available to Internet giants, allowing enterprises to innovate with disruptive speed. 
Some assets have been assembled to get you quickly up to speed on positioning and responding to your customers. 

These include an FAQ &lt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JOmyV6A2IQ7mbExh56DTg9hfseIfJSZNcEbGZN5l64E/edit?usp=sharing&gt;, a Pivotal CF Datasheet &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/PivotalCF-Datasheet&gt; and the Inside Pivotal CF website &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal-cf/&gt; where you can find pricing, packaging, support and services information. 
As an indication of the strategic value of our relationship, VMware is messaging the opportunity this announcement presents to their own internal team. On top of this, today&apos;s Wall Street Journal is promoting the platform on which the next great software companies will build their businesses - with the names of industry giants already participating in the Cloud Foundry community project. 

These are exciting times for Pivotal and we need to take a moment to recognize the achievement. 

Congratulations to all who have been a part of this global team effort. 

Best of luck in your pursuits...
