    <textOnly>Hi Team,

Providing customer proof points is a critical step in successful deal processes, but something that has too often been a source of risk and uncertainty.

Today we’re introducing a new way to easily share customer information with your early prospects, and also find the customer references you need to close out deals. Our new reference system is a native Salesforce.com application and accessible from your salesforce login, and you can learn more about this new system on the following resource page and the two recordings you will find there:
 


 - Reference System Resource Page &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/customer-marketing-and-programs/references/reference-system&gt;
 - I need a Reference, Help Me (17 min) &lt;https://pivotalfield.biglms.com/courses/PFS/TP100/VWN/about&gt;
 - Win Prizes and Help Pivotal Crush the Number (13 min) &lt;https://pivotalfield.biglms.com/courses/PFS/TP101/VWN/about&gt;


To support this process through 2014, we’re also introducing an incentive program which allows you to earn activity points for the fulfillment of sales and marketing reference requests. These points can then be redeemed for excellent prizes &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/customer-marketing-and-programs/references/2014-prize-catalog&gt;.

To get started, please take this survey &lt;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/MFFGZSL&gt; and provide us feedback on your current challenges with finding and fulfilling references.

For any questions about the reference system, prizes, or program, please contact Sophia Tseng &lt;mailto:stseng@pivotal.io&gt;.

Make it happen!</textOnly>
