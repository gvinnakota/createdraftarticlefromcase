    <subject>Executive Roundtable Discussion - July 2014</subject>
    <textOnly>Team,

Prior to the July 4th holiday, Scott Yara, James Watters, Edward Hieatt and Hugh Williams recorded an Exec Roundtable discussion regarding the progress of the Go-to-Market/Business teams and the key takeaways as we head into the second half of 2014. 

I think you will find their commentary and insights quite valuable, so please make the time to either watch the video &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/employee-information/executive-roundtable&gt; or listen to the audio podcast &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/employee-information/executive-roundtable&gt;. Thank you and here&apos;s to continuing on the path to a great 2014!

 
Best,</textOnly>
