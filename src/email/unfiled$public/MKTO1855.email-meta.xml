    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
We hope you enjoyed the Building Scalable Data Applications with Spring and GemFire &lt;http://spring.io/blog/2015/01/19/webinar-replay-building-scalable-data-applications-with-spring-and-gemfire&gt; webinar.

This session featured methods to simplify the configuration of a Pivotal GemFire grid using Spring Data GemFire, and explored how data is dynamically distributed and made highly available as the grid resources are increased or decreased to meet increased client demand.

Please feel free to share the on-demand replay of the webinar &lt;http://spring.io/blog/2015/01/19/webinar-replay-building-scalable-data-applications-with-spring-and-gemfire&gt; and the slides &lt;http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/building-scalable-web-applications-with-spring-data-gemfire&gt; with your colleagues!
