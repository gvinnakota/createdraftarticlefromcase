    <subject>Closing Q2 and Our Focus in Q3</subject>
    <textOnly>Team,

The book has officially closed on Q2 and the first half. I cannot go into specifics on how we fared until the quiet period ends, but I can say that we have a lot to be proud of and much to reflect upon. We had big-time wins with Philips Medical, IAG, Credit Suisse, BMO, Toshiba, Vodafone, Comcast, JP Morgan Chase, and the NFL – to name just a few. Pivotal CF, the Big Data Suite (BDS), and Pivotal Labs are on a tear. 

There is little doubt about the momentum we’re building. More than 1,000 attendees flocked to our recent Cloud Foundry Summit, where many customers presented stories about Pivotal CF and the way it’s transforming how they think of applications, infrastructure and their businesses. Our product roadmaps are more aligned than ever, and that is manifesting in the market.

So first, thank you!  

It’s been a privilege for me to work with each and every one of you. Your perseverance and teamwork that brought us to this point have been incredibly inspiring. As is the case for any market-facing team at the end of a quarter, it’s time to reset the clock and begin the work of making the new quarter and our second half happen in a big way. 

Education and Skills Development

We’re excited to 
offer more tools that will help you build your skills and confidence to create, execute, and close opportunities. In collaboration with Product Marketing and Field Enablement, we’re focused in Q3 on developing your ability to create PaaS and Big Data opportunities, and to refine your customer-facing messaging fluency for these strategic revenue drivers. We’re expecting to see 100% completion across the global field on both of the following initiatives.
Pivotal Field Accreditation

In July, you’ll take a series of Big Data and PaaS training videos (nine total) to develop your knowledge on market needs, customer personas, use cases, and the customer-facing story. Each video course is 20-30 minutes, and you’ll be able to access them through the NEW Pivotal Academy – and no longer rely on the EMC system to take training! You’ll have three weeks to complete these once the Accreditation launch email is sent out.
“Pivotal Ready” Stand-and-Deliver

In August, we’ll provide you Big Data and PaaS Messaging Whiteboards (PPT, role-play video, and storyboards for each), to help you start these conversations on the right foot, and 
create customer interest. We’ll be scheduling a series of regional stand-and-deliver workshops, so you can apply what you’ve learned. That workshop schedule is being organized now, and we’ll get that to you as soon as it’s finalized, so you can set aside time on your calendar. 

Rewards and Recognition

Lastly, more good news. We’ll continue to compensate – as we did in the first half of this year – on both Pivotal Services at EMC and on the sale of the DCA appliance. We’re also introducing a special incentive for both field representatives and field engineers for Pivotal CF wins in the second half. We have a hot product in a hot sector, and it’s all about getting a foothold and winning logos so we can stake our claim in the PaaS market. Look for more details in the coming days. 

We’re working hard to help you build that pipeline and create success! 

Once again, thank you for a tremendous effort in the first half, and I look forward to much success in Q3 and beyond.

Make it 
happen!</textOnly>
