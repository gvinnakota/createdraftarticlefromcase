 Chief of Staff, Products

Pivotal is Kind

 I witnessed so many acts of kindness this week. I saw food and gift containers overflowing with donations for those less fortunate and was sent photos of a group of our employees volunteering at the non-profit Family Giving Tree &lt;http://www.familygivingtree.org/&gt; 
(and having fun, I might add). Big thanks to all! I love that we have a social conscious.

 This edition of the biweekly Pivotal Newsletter calls out other areas where we give back; we’ll hear about Data Science’s “Pivotal for Good” initiative, our Cloud Foundry and Hadoop Open 
Source Projects, and Partnerships with Universities.

 That’s a wrap for 2013. The next edition of the Pivotal Newsletter will go out on January 9, 2014. Have a Happy New Year and good luck to Scott Aronson’s team as they close out a strong year!

BUSINESS UPDATE
Kaushik Das
 Senior Principal Data Scientist, Pivotal Data Labs

We are Busier than Ever!

 The Data Scientist (DS) role at Pivotal is a cross between R&amp;D, Pre-sales and Services. We have been very busy this quarter, as data science continues to capture the imagination of businesses and individuals worldwide. Of particular interest to us is how much our global presence is expanding. In APJ Greg Whalen heads the DS team which is engaged in Data Science Labs (which is what we call our projects) with Samsung, Posco and BISTel, while in EMEA our team headed by Michael Natusch have booked deals and/or have started working with R&amp;V, GfK, UKL, BMW, Allianz, TRG and Otto.

 One of the good examples from the US is Fidelity.

Fidelity is a large financial institution (they have multiple racks of DCA) that we’ve been working with for many months. We’ve engaged with their Workforce Investment department, specifically on 401K plans and how to make their clients (all of us!) feel more secure about their retirement. Our Data Scientists on the East Coast, Niels Kasch and Mariann Micsinai, have done a phenomenal job, along with our partners in Sales - Dan Mearls, and Project Management - Matthew Middleton, showing Fidelity how Big Data technology can completely change the way they make decisions. In fact, it is job so well done, that other groups at Fidelity are starting to notice and the floodgates are opening! Now another part of the company is interested in working with us on IT Security. We’re currently helping them identify a focused project through our &quot;Data Science Primer,&quot; a data audit to see what is possible.

 This multi-group interest is a trend we’re seeing at a few companies; we’re being asked to help build and improve Data Science Centers 
of Excellence at companies like: 


 - Fidelity
 - Reliance
 - VISA
 - Kaiser Permanente


Here are some of our other recent activities that I&apos;d like to highlight: 

 - Kaiser Code-a-Thon: All the great work Hulya Farinas and team have done in Healthcare earned us a spot (one of only four vendors) at Kaiser Permanente’s first Code-a-Thon &lt;http://centerfortotalhealth.org/tag/code-a-thon/&gt;, which took place in June at the Center for Total Health in Washington, D.C. WE WON THE CODE-A-THON! Read all about the challenge and our cool results on Hulya’s Pivotal P.O.V. Blog: Pivotal’s Experience at the Kaiser Code-a-Thon &lt;http://blog.gopivotal.com/p-o-v/pivotals-experience-at-the-kaiser-code-a-thon&gt;

 - DataBeat: Pivotal partnered with VentureBeat a couple of weeks ago to host DataBeat &lt;http://venturebeat.com/2013/10/22/introducing-databeat-a-partnership-between-pivotals-data-science-summit-and-venturebeat/&gt; - this year’s instantiation of our annual Data Science Summit. This is a big event for the Data Science community, especially in Silicon Valley. It not only provides an opportunity to reflect on the impact our community has had over the past year, but also to learn about cool new tools, apps and insights. It demonstrates Pivotal’s thought-leadership in Data Science and injects energy and enthusiasm into our team! Paul Davis wrote a nice Pivotal P.O.V. Blog: Doing More With Data at the Data Science Summit 2013 &lt;http://blog.gopivotal.com/news-2/doing-more-with-data-at-the-data-science-summit-2013&gt;
 - Pivotal for Good: I’m very pleased to share that we&apos;re partnering with DataKind &lt;http://www.datakind.org/&gt; to volunteer our Big Data expertise to non-profit organizations. It provides great job satisfaction to work for a company that promotes positive social change, provides opportunities to work on challenging problems, and give back in a meaningful way. Thanks to our fearless leader Annika Jimenez for making this happen. Again, thanks to Paul, we have a great Pivotal P.O.V. Blog: Solving for People: Pivotal for Good and DataKind Connects Data Scientists and Social Organizations &lt;http://blog.gopivotal.com/news-2/solving-for-people-pivotal-for-good-and-datakind-connects-data-scientists-and-social-organizations&gt;

Finally, I’d like to welcome Ronert Obst, the latest addition to Michael Natusch’s EMEA Data Science team. Welcome Ronert!

PRODUCT UPDATE
James Watters
 Head of Product, Cloud Foundry

We Developed, We Launched, and Momentum is Building!

 Since the formation of Pivotal as an independent company, the Cloud Foundry open source ecosystem &lt;http://cloudfoundry.com&gt; has progressed from a promising collection of early movers to the dominant pattern for enterprise PaaS. On November 12th, we celebrated the culmination of three years of development with the public launch of Pivotal CF &lt;http://gopivotal.com/paas&gt;, our enterprise PaaS powered by Cloud Foundry &lt;http://www.cloudfoundry.com&gt;. Pivotal CF is a complete PaaS cloud deployable onto VMware vSphere. It includes the Elastic Runtime (Cloud Foundry) and Pivotal Operations Manager (BOSH). Pivotal CF augments our hosted Cloud Foundry solution at run.pivotal.io &lt;http://run.pivotal.io&gt;, currently in beta, with true hybrid on-prem and public cloud solutions.

 This launch also welcomed the 
support of industry leading companies &lt;https://twitter.com/wattersjames/status/400154922282262529/photo/1&gt;, such as GE, IBM &lt;http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/2013/09/09/ibm-websphere-liberty-buildpack-contributed-to-cloud-foundry/&gt;, Intel &lt;http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/2012/08/16/drivers-behind-intels-choice-of-cloud-foundry/&gt;, NTT &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWKlx6vRHKQ&gt;, SAP &lt;http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/2013/12/11/sap-hana-service-broker-contributed-to-the-cloud-foundry-incubator/&gt; and Verizon in building the leading open PaaS, as well as the support of more than 750 individual contributors &lt;http://www.github.com/cloudfoundry&gt; who have submitted over 50,000 commits to the 130+ Cloud Foundry repos. 23 companies &lt;http://cloudfoundry.org/about&gt; have already signed our Contributor License Agreement &lt;https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributor-license-agreement&gt;, including Intel, IBM, Rakuten &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxmnff8lL5o&gt;, Savvis &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtnJDY2Vy2w&gt;, Swisscom and SAP. Over the course of 2014, we expect to add many more marquee names to this already impressive list of companies standing behind Cloud Foundry as both partners and customers.

 Here are another couple of highlights to share: 
 - Pivotal Network and Pivotal One: Pivotal Network &lt;http://network.gopivotal.com/products/pivotal-cf%20&gt; is our main software distribution system for Pivotal One. This is how we deliver a suite of applications and services on top of Pivotal CF &lt;http://network.gopivotal.com/products/pivotal-cf%20&gt;, starting with Pivotal Hadoop (PHD) &lt;https://network.gopivotal.com/products/pivotal-hd&gt;, Pivotal Analytics (AX) &lt;https://network.gopivotal.com/products/pivotal-ax&gt;, a MySQL service and our RabbitMQ &lt;https://network.gopivotal.com/products/pivotal-rabbitmq&gt; enterprise messaging system. Business developers and Enterprise IT teams will have a set of tools to build, update and scale applications with the ability to expand and upgrade the platform footprint instantly and with no downtime. The services are designed to meet the needs of developers who need data &lt;http://www.newsfactor.com/accuserve/accuserve-go.php?c=15458&gt; services and deep user analytics &lt;http://www.newsfactor.com/accuserve/accuserve-go.php?c=15241&gt; for massive data sets. Pivotal One reinforces Pivotal&apos;s mandate to be the standout technology company at the intersection of PaaS (platform as a service), big data, and agile development.

 - Partnership with Canonical for Cloud Foundry on Ubuntu Open Stack: At the OpenStack Summit &lt;http://www.openstack.org/summit/openstack-summit-hong-kong-2013/&gt; in Hong Kong, Canonical founder Mark 
Shuttleworth announced a partnership with Pivotal to include an integrated OpenStack-hosted PaaS based on Cloud Foundry &lt;http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/news/2240202645/IBM-joins-Pivotal-in-developing-Cloud-Foundrys-open-source-PaaS&gt; in the next major release of Ubuntu. Ubuntu is the base operating system for 80% of OpenStack clouds today, making this an important and strategic partnership that will help bolster Cloud Foundry&apos;s position as the leading OpenStack PaaS. We expect the first available distribution of Cloud Foundry running on Ubuntu Open Stack to be available in late Q1 or early Q2 2014. In addition, we are working with our customers and partners to explore additional IaaS distribution opportunities, including AWS, Google Compute Engine and others.

Key Talent, Critical Mass, and a Competitive Distribution!

 The Pivotal HD (PHD) team has had an outstanding year; we hired key talent, built 
critical mass, delivered releases and made PHD a competitive distribution in 2013! In addition, the Analytics Workbench &lt;http://www.analyticsworkbench.com/&gt; (AWB), our 1000 node HD cluster, has now on-boarded numerous external projects and is gaining momentum and visibility.

 I want to take this opportunity to introduce you to some of the key leaders of the PHD team: 

 - Milan Chutake, Judes Sarmiento: Engineering leads for installation, configuration and systems management, along with command center. Milan also manages our unified storage system project, which has developed a nice alignment within PXF and the larger HD ecosystem.
 - Alon Goldshuv: Long-term Greenplum veteran, is the engineering lead for the PXF project, being built in Israel.
 - Michael Lv: Leads the Shanghai-based PHD development team, focused on stack, tools, as well as Hamster (OpenMPI running on top of Hadoop) 
 - Andrew Bennett: Leads the program management effort across PHD releases, while supporting Pivotal Data Dispatch and other components.
 - Vitthal (Suhas) Gogate, Sameer Tiwari, Robert (Bob) Geiger: The three-person architect team providing support across PHD releases, PHD on PCF, DCA support, field support, engaging with partners, including VMW, Isilon, RSA, EMC.

Lastly, we have a stellar new addition to the team: Roman Shaposhnik &lt;http://venturebeat.com/2013/12/19/pivotal-nabs-one-of-clouderas-top-talents-hadoop-project-founder-shaposhnik/&gt; is the first Hadoop committer to 
join Pivotal. He is the founder of the open source Apache Bigtop project and a respected member of the committer community. He has a big charter to help with open source alignment.

Technical Operations
 The Techops team was formed in the middle of 2013 to help streamline the R&amp;D infrastructure and development tools across various geos and data centers. The team has worked tirelessly to set up an effective cloud-based development environment and enhance and maintain development tools.

 There has been significant progress made on understanding the existing inventory of equipment and, where applicable, reusing these for engineering 
needs. A key achievement was building out a 200-node end-to-end integration environment that resulted in a savings of $2.3M net new procurement.

 Key leaders of the team are: 

 - Bhavin Modi: Leads a small but effective team of devops engineers
 - Tashneem Maistry: Leads capex &amp; program management for techops, as well as an engagement lead for AWB
 - Clinton Ooi: Architect for networking and infrastructure. He is also leading the architecture effort for Heimdall - the unified and extensible command center project for the HD team

Last but not least, Taylor Gambucci, provides both teams fantastic admin support.

Partnering with Universities

 As part of my charter, I spend considerable time understanding various emerging technologies, and research efforts 
that are relevant to our product portfolio. I also shepherd our Pivotal Research Advisory Team, comprising of representatives from various teams within Pivotal, in sponsoring University Research, and other initiatives.

 The majority of our data products have benefited from exciting University research and many of the bright 
graduate students we collaborate with join us later as interns and full-time staff. Pivotal has sponsored three University projects in 2013: 

 - San Diego Supercomputing Center: Pivotal (and Greenplum, prior) is the founding sponsor for Center for Large Data Systems, at San Diego Supercomputing Center (http://clds.sdsc.edu/ &lt;http://clds.sdsc.edu/&gt;) . Jointly, we have organized 4 workshops on Big Data Benchmarking, and have initiated a Big Data Top 100 effort, that got accolades at White House OSTP event (http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/Data2Action%20Announcements.pdf &lt;http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/Data2Action%20Announcements.pdf&gt;).
 - University Of Florida: Prof. Daisy Wang (University of Florida) has been a long-time collaborator with Greenplum, having contributed Linear-Chain CRF Model and Viterbi inference to MADlib. This year, we have funded her collaborative work with Dr. Victor Fang, from the Data Science team, classifying images using a bag-of-visual-words model.
 - UC Berkeley: AMPLab, at UC Berkeley, is on the forefront of Data Infrastructure, where open source projects, such as Spark, Shark, and Mesos have originated. Pivotal became a joint sponsor of AMPLab (with EMC) this year. This sponsorship gives us an opportunity to guide AMPLab’s research to benefit our product lines, and gives us direct access to the brilliant minds at AMPLab.

AWB, described in Apurva’s update above, gives us an edge in developing meaningful relationships with brilliant researchers around the world. One example of such collaboration and a breakthrough we enabled using the scalability of our platform is a large-scale image reconstruction project by a consortium led by University College of London. Prof. David Selviah, the lead on this project, is a well-known authority in the Advanced Optics Laboratory at UCL. His group has developed a traveling microscope to scan vertical images (e.g. hanging art works at museums) at a resolution of 4 microns. On a single powerful server, reconstruction of the original image used to take 30 hours and after porting their algorithms to AWB using Pivotal HD, they saw 86x speed-ups!

 If you think our products would gain from path-breaking research being done at Universities around the world, 
please contact the Pivotal Research Advisory Team &lt;mailto:pivotalrat@gopivotal.com&gt;.
