FEATURED SESSION with CORNELIA DAVIS

Running Your Spring Apps in the Cloud 
The Spring Trader application was debuted at Spring One in 2012 and presented an application that demonstrates a multitude of Pivotal Application Fabric components working together – tcServer, RabbitMQ, SQLFire and Gemfire. In this session we will take that application and make (a few) modifications (mostly to config) to get it running on the same components in the cloud, specifically on the Cloud Foundry PaaS. We’ll show you how to use the Spring Cloud project to configure the deployment, how to leverage a cloud services catalog, how to implement a cross-site scripting solution (and why), how to do session state caching and we’ll discuss (the dangers of) auto reconfiguration. If you bring a laptop you can have your own instance of the app running by end of session. 

Huge Discount on Immersion Training at the show!

 This is a one-of-a-kind conference for application developers, solution and data architects who develop business applications, create multi-device aware web applications, process vast quantities of 
enterprise data, design cloud architectures, and manage high performance infrastructure. The sessions are specifically tailored for developers using the hugely popular open source Spring IO Projects, Groovy &amp; Grails, CloudFoundry, Hadoop and Tomcat technologies. Whether you&apos;re building mission-critical web or business applications, crunching huge amounts of distributed data, or designing the next killer cloud application, SpringOne 2GX will keep you up to date with the latest enterprise technology.
 
 Featuring presentations delivered by development leads, committers, and published authors, it&apos;s the ideal place to obtain critical skills to help you design, build and run tomorrow&apos;s software solutions. Plus you&apos;ll meet and learn from open source leaders who drive innovation for these technologies.
