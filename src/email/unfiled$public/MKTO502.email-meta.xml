Pivotal Xtension Framework (PXF) is an external table interface that gives SQL access on top of data stored within the Hadoop ecosystem. It enables loading and querying of data stored in HDFS, HBase and Hive. It supports a wide range of data formats such as Text, AVRO, Hive, Sequence, RCFile formats and HBase.

Alright, so maybe &quot;bootiful&quot; won&apos;t ever work, but I tried, and it was worth it too because you&apos;re reading this. Spring Boot, the new convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring&apos;s flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development not just fly, but pleasant!
