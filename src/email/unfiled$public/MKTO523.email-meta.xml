Toronto Relocation
A short 6 months following the acquisition of Xtreme Labs in Toronto, the team, formerly located at 69 Yonge Street, moved just a couple of blocks down the street to a new location. Fitting that we’re now located on Toronto Street. True to the Pivotal way, we have a large, 45,000 square foot open space spread across two floors. The office has amazing 360 degree views of the city and Lake Ontario and currently houses over 300 people with more to come! We look forward to seeing you at one of our upcoming meetups or events. If you’d like to schedule a tour, feel free to reach out.


Labs in London
On March 5th, we hosted customers and partners for our official UK launch party. The London office is our first for the EMEA region and is located in what’s referred to as &quot;The Silicon Roundabout.&quot; We were pleased to host companies such as Capital One, Barclays, TRG, Deutsche Bank, MBNL and others to celebrate the recent addition to the Pivotal family of locations and look forward to building on our presence in London. If you’re in the area, please stop by to say hello.

Android’s take on TDD &lt;http://pivotallabs.com/tdd-android-pov/&gt;

Test-driven development is an iterative process of writing automated tests that define a feature before development, writing code to pass the tests, and finally refactoring the code to meet project architecture standards.
