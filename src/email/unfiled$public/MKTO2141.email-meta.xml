FREE O’REILLY MICROSERVICES eBOOK: MIGRATING TO CLOUD-NATIVE APPLICATION ARCHITECTURES
Adoption of cloud-native application architectures is helping many organizations transform their IT into a force for true agility in the marketplace. This O’Reilly report defines the unique characteristics of cloud-native application architectures such as Microservices and twelve-factor applications.
 
Author Matt Stine also examines the cultural, organizational, and technical changes necessary to migrate traditional monolithic applications and service-oriented architectures to cloud-native architectures. You’ll also find a Migration Cookbook, with recipes for decomposing monolithic applications into Microservices, implementing fault-tolerant patterns, and performing automated testing of cloud-native services.
