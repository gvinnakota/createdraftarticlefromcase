    <textOnly>Team:

I am pleased to share that Drew Kramer will be joining Pivotal as our new CIO. Drew spent the past 10+ years at VMware, where he built the Technical Operations organization that was responsible for providing support services, infrastructure management and operational expertise to VMware&apos;s 6,000 person R&amp;D team. During that time, he also developed and implemented a 20MW, remote, consolidated, data center and provided support and connectivity to 50+ worldwide engineering sites. Drew was also the co-creator of OneCloud, VMware&apos;s industry-leading Infrastructure as a Service operation. Most recently, Drew led a world-class security organization focused on protecting all aspects of VMware&apos;s environment.
 
I feel incredibly fortunate to have someone with Drew&apos;s technical background and expertise in building world-class IT organizations join the Pivotal team. Drew will work to bring together the Technical Operations teams across Pivotal, as well as assuming day-to-day responsibilities for our Corporate IT functions. 
 
I would also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge Chris Curtis and his many accomplishments in building out our IT services organization from scratch. Chris has been the consummate team player and leader at Pivotal, willing to tackle any challenge confronting the business. When we asked Chris to serve as Pivotal&apos;s first VP of IT, he was clear that both his background and longer-term ambitions were not in corporate IT, but that he also realized the importance of having someone step-up to lead the effort. It&apos;s safe to say that Chris jumped in without skipping a beat, and put in place a team and infrastructure capable of supporting nearly 2,000 employees around the world.
 
Chris will be working closely with Drew over the coming months to transition his responsibilities for the organization, and will be exploring new opportunities within Pivotal and the Federation with Bill and myself.
 
On behalf of the leadership team, I would like to thank Chris for his contributions and hard-efforts. 
 
Regards,
