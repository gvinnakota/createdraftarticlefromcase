Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},





I would like to invite you to join me in Singapore this month for our first Asia Pacific Summit. I am very excited to speak with you about creating modern software companies. I anticipate that this event will be insightful and informative, with two full days of workshops and in-depth discussions. 
The technology industry is experiencing a major change. The wide-scale move to cloud computing is transforming the ways that infrastructure and applications will be built and used. Enterprises require a new generation of increasingly mobile and data-centric applications to drive new business value. 
At our first Asia Pacific Summit, held on October 23-24, you will have the unique opportunity to become part of this extraordinary movement. Joined by my team of senior industry experts and key customers, I will be sharing the mission for Pivotal – to enable your company to build great software and create true business value.
Visit our event website &lt;http://www.pivotalsummit.shobiziems.com/&gt; and learn more about how to register &lt;http://www.pivotalsummit.shobiziems.com/register.php&gt;.
I am looking forward  to connecting with you in person and hope you&apos;ll be able to attend.
 




Best Regards,

Paul Maritz
CEO, Pivotal
