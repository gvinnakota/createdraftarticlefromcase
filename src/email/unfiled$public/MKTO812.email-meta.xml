Hello {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

The first Cloud Foundry Summit fueled by the support of the Cloud Foundry Foundation has wrapped—and what a difference the power of the ecosystem made!




&quot;Open source has become a very effective approach to enable people to come together and build a standard platform.&quot;
— Paul Maritz, CEO, Pivotal
