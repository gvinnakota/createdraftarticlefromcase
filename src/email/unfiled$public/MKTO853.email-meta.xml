    <subject>An Important Message from the Office  of the General Counsel</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi Team,

 Pivotal&apos;s Business Conduct Guidelines &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/document_repository/Pivotal%20Business%20Conduct%20Guidelines%20--%20June%202014.pdf?attredirects=0&amp;d=1&gt; 
discuss Pivotal&apos;s core value of 
 integrity, contain key policies, and provide information about the hotline 
 process for our people to communicate internal complaints. 

As Paul Maritz has said, at Pivotal, we are custodians of something special, and &quot;it&apos;s not just what we do, but how we do it.&quot; It is up to each of us to help build Pivotal on a solid foundation of integrity. Most of the time, your own sense of right and wrong is all you&apos;ll need, but if you have questions about compliance, please refer to the Guidelines, contact the Office of the General Counsel &lt;mailto:generalcounsel@gopivotal.com&gt;, or contact me &lt;mailto:acohen@gopivotal.com&gt; directly.

 Make it Happen.
