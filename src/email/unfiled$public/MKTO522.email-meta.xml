The sessions are specifically tailored for developers using the hugely popular open source Spring IO Projects, Groovy &amp; Grails, CloudFoundry, Hadoop and Tomcat technologies. Whether you’re building mission-critical web or business applications, crunching huge amounts of distributed data, or designing the next killer cloud application, SpringOne 2GX will keep you up to date with the latest enterprise technology.

Featuring presentations delivered by development leads, committers, and published authors, it’s the ideal place to obtain critical skills to help you design, build and run tomorrow’s software solutions. Plus you’ll meet and learn from open source leaders who drive innovation for these technologies.

FEATURED SESSION

PAINLESS BUILD AND DEPLOY

FOR YARN APPLICATIONS WITH SPRING with Thomas Risberg

Spring’s goal, like any good framework, has always been to handle the infrastructure so you can focus on your application code. Join this session to see how Spring provides a simple programming model to develop applications than can easily be tested and deployed as either a YARN application or a traditional application. No longer will you need to struggle with 3rd party library build and packaging issues, XML, and how the YARN Appmasters, Clients and Resource Managers all work together. The magic of Spring Boot, Spring XD, and Spring for Apache Hadoop just make it all work so you can get coding!
