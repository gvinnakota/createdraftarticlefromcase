    <subject>Pivotal and VMware’s Big Moment</subject>
    <textOnly>Team,

 On Sunday VMware charged into its “momentum season” by kicking off its annual showcase event, VMworld in San Francisco &lt;http://www.vmworld.com/index.jspa&gt;. To help enterprises become agile, fast, mobile-first modern companies, VMware has wrapped big themes around that momentum. They include:


 - A New Model of IT based on Choice and Open Standards
 - Software-Defined is Inevitable 
 - Enterprises are Choosing Hybrid Cloud 
 - The Hyper-Converged Infrastructure—New Building Blocks for the Software-Defined Data Center 
 - A Unified Platform for a Mobile, Modern Workforce 


VMware’s themes are an opportunity to amplify Pivotal’s focus on the importance of modern applications, built on an open cloud platform. This week Pivotal brings strong marketing air cover at VMworld to showcase our alignment in bringing agility to the enterprise through the software-defined infrastructure. Pivotal underscores VMware’s big themes with the following:


 - Choice and flexibility: Pivotal CF and VMware combine to help enterprises deliver workloads where they see fit; distribute app lifecycles across clouds; add choice in who operates workloads and where; and allows them to be distributed based on needs. Pivotal CF is optimized to allow VMware environments to deploy on-premise (vSphere or vCloud Director®) or in the cloud (vCloud Air) 
 - Mobile-first: Pivotal CF (and its new mobile services) on vCloud Air allow enterprises to deploy workflows on-premise, or in the cloud. Customers can run mobile apps on vCloud Air at scale, while leveraging insights gained from analytics that run in their own data warehouses. This creates the flexibility and portability that will help any enterprise become a mobile-first organization.
 - Manage With Ease: Whether on-premise through Pivotal CF, or in the cloud through vCloud Air, the governance and policy from vCloud Automation Center, combined with the open API’s and powerful automation of Pivotal CF, VMware and Pivotal make it easier to manage legacy systems and the demands of continuous, reliable, modern app development.


We have a great opportunity to bring those messages to enterprise customers. Starting at VMworld this week, we are highlighting the joint value propositions through breakouts, sessions and demos.

Please watch this useful internal video &lt;https://drive.google.com/a/pivotal.io/file/d/0Bz8zpYijd4oxODF2VTNTSVJ0Ymc/edit?usp=sharing&gt; which captures Pivotal and VMware executives summarizing all the points of opportunity we have through this unique partnership. Now is the time to capture this momentum with joint wins. We have joint customer goals for on premise Pivotal CF wins, and wins that land on vCloud, exiting Q4. All sales representatives and field engineers should align with their VMware counterparts to identify top joint prospects, and build second half account plans. Let’s deliver on this potential!

 Make it happen!</textOnly>
