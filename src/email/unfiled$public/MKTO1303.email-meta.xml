If you are concerned with the business end of your organisation, want to know why Platform as a Service (PaaS) is getting the ears of the board? Want to know how it can change the 
way you compete in the market via technology innovation? 

 Attend to learn what PaaS can do and see what clever organisations are doing to outpace new market entrants and leapfrog existing ones. 

 If you are interested in developing, deploying, and scaling applications for the Cloud Generation then stay for the workshop. Join the Pivotal engineering team for a hands-on workshop with Pivotal Cloud Foundry while you network with peers and build some new skills.
