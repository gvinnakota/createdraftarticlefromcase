Speaker: Juergen Hoeller

In recent years, the Spring Framework focuses on flexible and powerful Java-based configuration. This talk presents Spring as an annotation-oriented application framework, illustrating the rich set of features that Spring has to offer for modern component design. 

General component model trends will be discussed along with selected Spring feature highlights, such as standardized annotations for dependency injection, stereotypes, and declarative services such as validation and scheduling.
