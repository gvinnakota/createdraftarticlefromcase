Spring Framework 4 on Java 8
Speaker: Juergen Hoeller and the Spring Team

Spring has a track record of providing dedicated support for new Java generations in a timely fashion, and now itâ€™s right about time to go Java 8: With Spring Framework 4.0, we&apos;re providing in-depth support for all relevant OpenJDK 8 features, including lambda expressions, JSR-310 Date and Time, parameter name discovery, and java.util.concurrent enhancements.

This talk will illustrate basic Spring Framework 4.0 concepts, and selected Java 8 features within Spring&apos;s programming model, exploring the impact on application architectures.
