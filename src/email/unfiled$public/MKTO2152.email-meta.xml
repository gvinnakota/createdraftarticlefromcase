    <textOnly>Building a secure Polymer app with Spring backend
Speaker: Scott Deeg

Polymer is the latest web framework out of Google. Designed completely around the emerging Web Components standards, it has the lofty goal of making it easy to build apps based on these low level primitives. Along with Polymer comes a new set of Elements (buttons, dialog boxes and such) based on the ideas of &quot;Material Design&quot;. These technologies together make it easy to build responsive, componentized &quot;Single Page&quot; web applications that work for browsers on PCs or mobile devices. But what about the backend, and how do we make these apps secure?

In this talk Scott Deeg will take you through an introduction to Polmyer and its related technologies, and then through the build out of a full blown cloud based app with a secure, RESTful backend based on Spring REST, Spring Cloud, and Spring Security and using Thymeleaf for backend rendering jobs. At the end he will show the principles applied in a tool he&apos;s currently building. The talk will be mainly code walk through and demo, and assumes familiarity with Java/Spring and JavaScript.

Smarter Service-to-Service Invocations with Spring Cloud
Speaker: Josh Long 

Spring Cloud 1.0 is here! It offers a powerful way to create and consume microservices. As you introduce new services, you introduce integration problems: services can be shaky, they can disappear and - as they&apos;re often exposed over HTTP - they require a bit more footwork than in-process method invocations.

In this webinar, we&apos;ll focus specifically on how Spring Cloud integrates service registration (e.g.: Eureka, Consul, or Zookeeper), declarative REST clients (with Netflix&apos;s Feign), reactive programming and the circuit breaker pattern with Hystrix to support easy, robust service-to-service invocations.

This is a deep dive on how to make connect and consume microservices, and is a natural next step after my introduction to building microservices with Spring Cloud.

Reactive data-pipelines with Spring XD and Kafka
Speakers: Marius Bogoevici &amp; Mark Pollack

In the recent years, drastic increases in data volume as well as a greater demand for low latency have led to a radical shift in business requirements and application development methods. In response to these demands, frameworks such as RxJava and high throughput messaging systems such as Kafka have emerged as key building blocks.

However, integrating technologies is never easy and Spring XD provides a solution. Through its development model and runtime, Spring XD makes it easy to develop highly scalable data pipelines, and lets you focus on writing and testing business logic vs. integrating and scaling a big data stack.

Come and see how easy this can be in this webinar, where we will demonstrate how to build highly scalable data pipelines with RxJava and Kafka, using Spring XD as a platform.
