    <subject>Pivotal&apos;s Open Source Indemnification Program</subject>
    <textOnly>Team,

 I&apos;m pleased to announce Pivotal&apos;s Open Source Indemnification Program (“the Program &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/open-source-indemnification-program&gt;”). The Program provides Pivotal customers with protection against intellectual property claims based on Pivotal-developed open source software in our products. The Program allows ​you to proactively highlight to customers the indemnification protections we offer. Please see our &quot;Talking Points &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=cGl2b3RhbC5pb3xpbnNpZGUtcGl2b3RhbHxneDozNWRmYTg1ZTY3ODJjYjUz&gt;&quot;, which are for your internal use, and which will help you explain Pivotal&apos;s indemnity policy to customers, promote deal velocity, and ensure that we speak with a unified voice about our policies.

The Program and Talking Points demonstrate that Pivotal&apos;s polices are industry-standard, and in many cases, better than what our competition offers. We will soon release a video featuring Pivotal’s executives to further underscore the rationale behind the Program and our indemnification policy. 

Please reach out to me &lt;mailto:acohen@pivotal.io&gt; or to Susie Gilfix &lt;mailto:sgilfix@pivotal.io&gt; with any questions about the Program or the Talking Points.

 Make it Happen.
