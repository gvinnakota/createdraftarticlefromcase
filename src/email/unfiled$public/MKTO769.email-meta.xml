PIVOTAL NEWSLETTER
 Vol. 2, No. 12










 









EDITOR WELCOME

 Sr. Manager, Corporate Communications







What’s the Story?

 A newsletter has its calculus: Planning, soliciting, deadlines, reminders (send many, be nice), judgments on length, tone and voice, word 
choice, negotiations and rewrites, headlines, format with team. Send. Repeat.

 As Rhonda Baldwin &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/916740-rhondabaldwin&gt;—who orchestrated this like clockwork—can attest, producing something like that involves all of the 
above, every cycle. Standing up this newsletter is as much a matter of will as it is anything else.

 The newsletter is also a digest of points in time spanning Pivotal businesses and offices. During this process, it’s been cool to see what New York is up to, or what the data fabric team brings to the picture. It reminds me how ambitious Pivotal is, and the value of the sum of its parts.

 So while we’re looking at a new format to make the newsletter easier to consume and access – as a whole, or the parts you like – my aim is fidelity to the process and to tying it all 
together.

 I’ll close with the impression that stuck from this week’s Cloud Foundry Summit &lt;http://cfsummit.com/&gt;. During the opening panel, Jason Wray from CenturyLink related his asking an app developer about Cloud Foundry. The developer’s face lit up when he responded, “No muss, no fuss, it’s fast, it’s beautiful.” Others I spoke with later that evening remembered that part clearly.

 That’s a Pivotal success story. And that’s my other job: To steer our contributors to the great stories behind their work. We have an outstanding opportunity. I hope to serve it well.

The Vision for Customer Success

How do we create an industry-defining, post-sales experience for our early adopter customers in this nascent 
market, at scale and through a global ecosystem of partners?

 This is the essential (and complex!) question we tackled at our first Customer Success Organization (CSO) global leadership meeting last week in Palo Alto.

 The ultimate outcomes we want to achieve are clear: 


 - To create market beacons from customers that are early adopters of our technologies. 
 - To increase customer retention and total lifetime value (increasingly measured through subscription renewal rates).
 - To develop a self-reinforcing ecosystem of enabled partners and customers.


To achieve these, CSO core competencies must lie both in strategic upstream activities that provide an environment for customer success, and downstream activities that support tactical project engagements on a daily basis.

 Upstream CSO competencies include: 


 - Building vibrant customer communities around Pivotal technologies through education, certification and knowledge sharing.
 - Creating a rich ecosystem of Pivotal-accredited service partners.
 - Capturing Pivotal architectural and subject-matter expertise in easy-to-sell, easy-to-consume service packages.


Downstream CSO competencies include: 


 - Orchestrating service delivery across multiple internal and external providers as a seamless experience that meets customer business objectives.
 - Managing customer issues to resolution through scalable, SLA-driven issue resolution processes.
 - Scaling this with consistency, which is a long-term project involving a high degree of collaboration with teams across Pivotal. At the same time, we must continue our focus on making our customers successful now.


It’s great to be on board, and we look forward to communicating more details of our plan in the coming weeks and months, and working with our many Pivotal stakeholders to support the success of our customers!











PRODUCT UPDATE

Data Fabric and the Road to Enterprise-Grade Hadoop

 It’s been an exciting few months in Data Fabric. Product teams across the business made significant progress on key new releases, important partnerships and a strong roadmap throughout 2014. All are helping extend our leadership, and for this update, I’ll focus on what we’re up to with Hadoop/HAWQ &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/groups/79496-championsphd&gt;.

 The most 
significant recent product launch in Data Fabric was Pivotal HD 2.0.1 (including Gemfire XD 1.0 and HAWQ 1.2). This major release rebased our Hadoop offering to Apache Hadoop 2.2 GA, and starts our journey to “enterprise grade” in 2014. We’re focused on quality and the configuration experience – areas critical to ensuring success in production environments. Feedback from the Field and customers has been very positive.

 The GA of GemfireXD 1.0 and HAWQ 1.2 – the full MADlib library of analytic functions and expanded user-defined functionality around PL/R, PL/Python etc., in particular – truly differentiate Pivotal HD by 
enabling data workers to realize the “store everything, analyze anything and build the right thing” approach that enterprises value. We showcased a short demo of Pivotal HD 2.0.1 &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/file/d/0B0t7H-qf8TRVOUVfa080SXdCNW8/edit&gt; at the recent Hadoop Summit 2014 &lt;http://hadoopsummit.org/san-jose/&gt;.

 Innovation in the dynamic Hadoop ecosystem occurs at a staggering pace, and we’ll continue to harvest open source thoughtfully. Apache Spark, a MapReduce-like cluster computation framework that allows fast, simple Hadoop adoption, is a popular request from customers. Thanks to the notable efforts of an engineering and product management tiger team, Pivotal HD is now certified with Apache Spark. Check out this guest blog &lt;http://databricks.com/blog/2014/05/23/pivotal-hadoop-integrates-the-full-apache-spark-stack.html&gt;, by Sarabjeet Chugh from product management, and this FAQ &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/document/d/1jrBkrOx5YQxXIo0j8Zv_HGz1R0rUO7eqI6UteeGMk4E/edit&gt; on Apache Spark.

 A more secure Hadoop is important to the enterprise. We’re engaged closely with customers and prospects to understand pain points, and to demonstrate existing and future security capabilities. Security is a big part of our 2014 plan, so stay tuned for news on our investment and partnerships.

 We have a once in a lifetime opportunity in Data Fabric, and we’re working hard to capture it. With an intense focus on success through quality, enterprise-grade differentiation, I’m confident that we’ll break away and solidify our position as leaders and the customers’ data choice.

Pivotal Labs New York is Red Hot

 Hello from the Big Apple!

 This month Pivotal Labs New York turns six, and we couldn’t be more 
proud of the team that we’ve built and our many accomplishments. That celebration includes a swanky new downtown office &lt;http://pivotallabs.com/contact/locations/&gt; (our fifth in six years – now that’s growth!), and integrating with the larger Pivotal team. We’ve been heads down this year ensuring that we continue to succeed big. We’ve expanded our skillsets beyond Rails, by leveling up our local mobile practice, and we’re working with the Spring team to deliver some amazing client engagements.


Downtown groove: Pivotal Labs New York offices

 We continue to forge new experiences and address old challenges in new ways through great apps. Our more recent projects include an iPhone app for MoMA (that was recently featured at WWDC &lt;https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/&gt;), a Spring 4 app for MLB Advanced Media that will help power their new 120 Sports &lt;http://www.120sports.com/&gt; Network (120 Sports is a new network and sports franchise partnership driving a brand new way to combine data and apps to intuitively stream video on preferred devices) and a new iPad app for the 
Arnold Foundation &lt;http://www.arnoldfoundation.org/&gt; (an organization working with the justice system to remove witness bias while selecting suspects out of lineups).

 We’re also very excited for the 
LAUNCH Beacon &lt;http://connect.gopivotal.com/uYA0005UoN0C0102UYlIJ10&gt; event and the Northside 
Innovation conference, which we’re sponsoring this week. We’ll be hosting a fireside chat with the CEO of Shutterstock and a VIP party for clients and friends of Pivotal.

 In addition to great customer work, we’re very excited to contribute to Pivotal CF &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/platform-as-a-service/pivotal-cf&gt; through our development efforts on Pivotal Network &lt;https://network.gopivotal.com/&gt; and the CF Build Packs &lt;http://docs.gopivotal.com/pivotalcf/buildpacks/&gt; projects.

 We’re growing, and still hiring. If you know great developers, PMs or designers, please send them to recruiting@pivotallabs.com &lt;mailto:recruiting@pivotallabs.com&gt;.












PEOPLE UPDATE

Corporate Development in High Gear

 Strategy &amp; Corporate Development is in high gear this summer. Pivotal closed a phenomenally successful Cloud Foundry Summit &lt;http://cfsummit.com/&gt; on Wednesday – where close to 1,000 customers, members and developers from across the Cloud Foundry community gathered to 
discuss the current and future state of the industry’s top PaaS. The over 1,300 developer contributions to date, and the range of ideas, confirm that Cloud Foundry is a game changer.

 This also marked a high point for the Cloud Foundry Foundation. With 35 companies now signed on to join the CF Foundation &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/platform-as-a-service/press-release/06092014-cloud-foundry-foundation-adds-swisscom-to-roster&gt; at Platinum, Gold and Silver levels 
(the addition of our latest Gold member, Swisscom, was announced at the Summit), we have critical mass across industries and geographies from companies large and small. As Paul Maritz noted, turning over the Cloud Foundry project to the non-profit foundation this fall reaffirms our belief that the soul of this movement remains open source for an open platform.

 At the Raymond James Internet and Software Crossover Conference (a recent investor 
relations event I participated in through the EMC Investor Relations team), the reactions from the Street told me that the Pivotal and EMC Federation &lt;http://emcfederation.com/&gt; story is resonating. We now need to focus on execution and making our customers and partners successful.

 We continue to build our partner ecosystem and support programs. With a focus on security, Sqrrl, Dataguise and Protegrity are now all working with Pivotal HD. We’re also finalizing agreements with CloudBees Jenkins and Datastax Cassandra to make them part of the Pivotal CF ecosystem. Additionally, to recruit and better support partners, we’ve launched a public partner portal &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/partners/tech&gt; that gives us better visibility into partner activities.

 
We’re looking ahead to the Fall for The Cloud Foundry Foundation kick off, and more!











HELLO, MY NAME IS…
Rhonda Baldwin
 Chief of Staff, Products







At Pivotal, I…
I help keep the trains running on time for Scott Yara. My LinkedIn &lt;http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rhonda-baldwin/18/4b2/bb/&gt; profile sums it up pretty well: 1) Execution, Communication, and Morale for the Products team, 2) Cross-Functional Collaboration, and 3) Special 
Projects.

You can find me…
 in Palo Alto most days, or San Francisco every other Thursday.

Currently, I am working on…
 A special project with Sales, Marketing, Product Marketing, our Customer Success Organization, EMC 
IT and an awesome Pivotal Labs team in Toronto. We’re building a cross-Federation mobile app that showcases our technology – it’s a cool project and I’m having a lot of fun doing it! 

In my spare time…
 I spend time with my husband and two dogs (9-year-old Rottweiler 
“Gabe” and 5-year-old Black Lab “Nova”). We take advantage of the beautiful California weather and get outside as much as possible; we enjoy camping, fly fishing, hiking, mountain biking and golfing. 

Something you probably don’t know about me…
 I’ve kept every T-shirt and hoodie I received from Greenplum, EMC, and Pivotal since joining in September 2010 (I never worked at Isilon, but they invited me to a BBQ and gave me a T-shirt, so I kept 
that one too). I like the collection because it tells a great story. 


To me Pivotal…
 Means opportunity. Opportunity to collaborate with fantastic people; opportunity to build industry-leading technology; opportunity to grow.
