    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Sorry we missed you at the Pivotal Cloud Platform Roadshow in Sydney on Thursday, June 18th. Our workshop gave attendees the opportunity to collaborate with their peers and get hands-on experience pushing an app on Pivotal CF. All of our sessions were designed to give users a deep dive into PaaS and how it can change the way companies develop, deploy and scale applications for the cloud generation. 

We have made our presentation slides available here &lt;http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/tagged/pivotal%20cloud%20platform%20roadshow&gt; and invite you to visit run.pivotal.io &lt;https://run.pivotal.io/&gt; to try Pivotal Web Services - simply upload your files and your app just works!

Interested in connecting with us? Please contact us &lt;mailto:info@pivotal.io&gt; to learn more.

Hope to see you next time.

The Pivotal Team</textOnly>
