We   believed that this pivot in the industry would require a new platform, and that this challenge would   require a new company.

<p><strong>To meet this challenge, we brought together five groups with relevant experience:</strong><br /> the Greenplum team, the Spring/vFabric team, the GemFire team, the Cloud Foundry team, and   Pivotal Labs, each with largely separate products and cultures, to forge a new independent   company.</p>
<p>I am happy to say that we have come an enormous way since then. In the last 12 months,   we have:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin: 5px 0;"> Given birth to a new, legally separate company, </li>
<li style="margin: 5px 0;"> Forged a new, unified field sales and operational team, </li>
<li style="margin: 5px 0;">Taken in an investment from GE as the foundation for our strategic partnership, </li>
<li style="margin: 5px 0;">Continued to release and support new major versions of existing products, </li>
<li style="margin: 5px 0;">Grown the Pivotal Labs business and opened new locations, </li>
<li style="margin: 5px 0;">Made our first acquisition of Xtreme Labs, </li>
<li style="margin: 5px 0;">Hit our sales targets in Q2, Q3, and Q4, </li>
<li style="margin: 5px 0;">Had significant successes with major companies all over the world (Visa, FBI, JPMC, Verizon,   Monsanto, Ministry of Railways-China, Vodafone, and many more), </li>
<li style="margin: 5px 0;">Built incredible industry support behind Cloud Foundry while renewing the team and technology, </li>
<li style="margin: 5px 0;">With remarkable effort, released our first unified technology suite, Pivotal One, which brings   together Pivotal CF, Pivotal HD, Pivotal GemFire XD, Spring, and RabbitMQ, thus pointing and   proving the way to the future, </li>
<li style="margin: 5px 0;">Attracted enormous customer interest with a message, a team, and a journey that truly   resonates with them, </li>
<li style="margin: 5px 0;">And along the way, we have learned so much. </li>
</ul>
<p>Whew! Thanks to all of you for these important accomplishments. With the great people   we have in all parts of the company, we have laid the foundation for something extraordinary. I encourage you all to reflect on the talent and work ethic of the people around you.</p>

<p><strong>In the last year, the basic thesis that led us to form Pivotal has grown stronger and   more urgent.</strong> To drive new business value and be competitive, enterprises need to navigate the   "magic cycle" of Applications, Data, and Analytics in a fundamentally faster, larger-scale, and more   cost-effective way than they can on their current platforms.</p>
<p>This fundamental need covers all industries and speaks to all companies and organizations,   including financial and consumer markets, as well as challenging areas such as energy and resource   efficiency, retail, healthcare, and food supply.</p>
<p>IDC, a leading research firm, has publicized the notion that the whole industry is in the beginning of   a major shift to the "3rd Platform" (the 1st being the mainframe, and the 2nd being client-server/web).   Large technology platform shifts like this come around only every few decades and are ultimately   very disruptive to existing players. Moreover, customers sense this. Here is additional insight from   another leading research firm, Gartner:</p>
<ul>
<strong>"Gartner, a research firm, says that in a recent survey of chief information officers,   two-thirds said they expected to change their primary IT suppliers by 2017. Asked to   name the most influential vendor of the next 10 years, they placed Apple third, Google   second - and an unnamed 'different vendor' at the top."</strong> 
</ul>
<p>Customers are looking for vendors that provide an open but integrated approach to the challenge   they face of developing new applications, exploiting new and much larger sources of data, and   getting the cost and operational advantages of the cloud, without being locked into a particular   cloud provider. They are looking for the new platform and ecosystem to provide what they need.</p>
<p>We have the opportunity to be that "different vendor." We can aspire to this role because we have   brought together the necessary vision, people, assets, and experience and have been given the   necessary structure, independence, and investment. So far this approach is unique in the industry.   Other competitors have pieces of the puzzle, but we have a head start on putting together an   integrated and focused critical mass of what is needed. Further, by adopting, creating, and fostering   key open source elements of the new platform - such as Cloud Foundry, we are encouraging the   emergence of a new ecosystem.</p>
<p>Our investors - EMC, VMware, and GE - have placed enormous and humbling faith in our ability   to turn this opportunity into an engine for growth. They have committed hundreds of millions of   dollars to enable us to provide customers with new capabilities, and in doing so build a large, fast   growing, and profitable "3rd Platform" business.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2013, we could only paint a broad vision of how the pieces coming into Pivotal   would combine to accomplish this goal. Now, thanks to a lot of hard work by all of you, we are in   striking distance of making it real.</p>

<p><strong>Having been present at the birth of the previous major platform shift to the "2nd   generation" client-server platform, and having been part of building out new businesses   in that era in the face of big incumbent "1st generation" competitors,</strong> I know that if you   enable something that is hard or expensive to do using existing means, and you are on the right   side of where technology is going, and you have developers on your side - then the tide will do its   work. We need to get decisively in front of the "3rd generation" tide in 2014.</p>
<p>Additionally, in many of our engagements to date, we have come up against the large, traditional   incumbent vendors, and many of the major wins we have notched up have been hard fought,   resource intensive, and drawn out. In many cases, we have had to compete in individual product   categories as opposed to bringing all the strengths of Pivotal to bear. It will be difficult to drive the   growth and profitability we need if we continue in this "siloed" mode, and even more important,   we risk missing the shift to the new platform opportunity.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if we rapidly build out an integrated suite of products to ride the new wave, we will   then be carried by customer demand and will put distance between ourselves and our existing   competitors, neutralizing their advantages of scale and incumbency. Make no mistake, customers   are validating this hypothesis. The conviction that lead GE to make an investment in us is being   echoed by the deep engagements unfolding now at the likes of Verizon, Monsanto, AT&amp;T, and   Capgemini, as well as the beginnings of long-term engagements at many others.</p>
<p>In 2014 we need to make delivering and aggressively getting into the game, with the new platform   suite, our highest priority. This task is going to require hard work and taking risk. But we don't have   a choice. The alternative is to continue trench warfare with the large, "2nd generation" platform   incumbents and risk missing the tide.</p>
<p>So what is our new "3rd generation" platform, and how should we be leveraging our assets to   make it a reality?</p>
<p>At a high level, the Pivotal One platform is our suite of software that will enable enterprises to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin: 5px 0;">Perform the "magic cycle" of apps, data, and analytics, </li>
<li style="margin: 5px 0;">Faster, at much greater scale, more cost-effectively, </li>
<li style="margin: 5px 0;">In a common automated, cloud-independent way, </li>
<li style="margin: 5px 0;">Leveraging the quantities that modern clouds make plentiful: lots of cheap machines and   cheap storage. </li>
</ul>
<p>From an ingredient point of view, our current products and the Pivotal One platform can be   summarized in the diagram below:</p>

<p><strong>As we build our detailed plans for 2014, we are asking all parts of Pivotal to rally behind   this decisive pivot to Pivotal One.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In 2014 we need to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>Fill out and bring Pivotal One to market so that we can secure 50% of our 2014 product revenues from Pivotal One and its ingredients.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>This is a big challenge since we just released our first incarnation of Pivotal One. We need to put   the R&amp;D plans as well as the "Go-to-Market" and "Support" plans in place to do this.</p>
<p>It will also mean:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin: 5px 0;">Our great Pivotal Labs and Data Science teams need to continue to be trusted advisors to   customers, and be an important source of growth and a conduit of learning for the whole   company. We need to do the work to give these teams the familiarity and confidence in Pivotal   One so they can recommend it to customers, and we need to execute on the feedback gained. </li>
<li style="margin: 5px 0;">Making it easy and attractive for our Spring, RabbitMQ, and Redis customers to write great   applications by leveraging Pivotal One. </li>
<li style="margin: 5px 0;">Moving our existing solutions (RTI, etc.) and new solutions to Pivotal One. </li>
<li style="margin: 5px 0;">Building the bridges and connections that encourage the EMC, RSA, and VMware sales teams to   see Pivotal One as an opportunity for them too, and have them pulling for us. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This pivot will also mean that we must secure the other 50% of our revenue from   existing, "stand-alone" products!</strong> Continuing to service customers for these products and   thinking through the associated roadmaps will be essential to our success.</p>
<p>Breaking out in 2014 is going to involve doing a lot of hard thinking, planning, and decision making   in a short space of time. We have work streams in place to address the above points and will have   basic yet specific plans and priorities in place in time for the Pivotal Worldwide Sales Kickoff   Meeting on February 10.</p>

<p><strong>We have great resources at our disposal, but only if we harness them in an agile and   unified way will we get ahead of both the big incumbents and the new entrants that will   inevitably be attracted to the new wave.</strong> We need, across the company, to unite and embody   all that is good in "agile": laying out clear goals, making clear decisions, breaking things up into   steps that allow us to get timely and meaningful feedback, and acting on that feedback.</p>
<p>Most important, we all have to embrace the pivot to Pivotal One. Tough tradeoffs will need to be   made. We don't have the capacity or time to do everything, including many things that in a perfect   world we should and would do. How one does things is as important as what one does - being   half-hearted or passive-aggressive is the worst of all worlds. Therefore, I ask you to always give your   best ideas and feedback, and then join forces and help make it happen.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to say what a privilege it is for me to work with all of you on this endeavor.   Opportunities to be part of a whole new wave in any industry don't come along that often. To be   able to do this work with the extraordinary team that we have is simply amazing. If we challenge and   support each other in ways that bring out the best in all of us, we will do something meaningful and we   will be proud of the way we did it. People will say, and we will know, that we gave more than we took.</p>
