    <textOnly>Team,

As we execute on our data strategy and vision, we need to align our efforts across our portfolio of data products, articulate a clear value proposition to the market, and deliver on an intense roadmap of product launches.

To further 
these goals and effective immediately, I have asked Nithin Rao to take on the role of Director of Product Management, Data Products. His team now includes the product leaders for PHD/Ambari, HAWQ, Greenplum DB and MADlib as well as the Advanced Platform Engineering team. Sudhir Menon will continue to focus on and lead the Gemfire product line.

Nithin came to Pivotal along with the Xtreme Labs acquisition in 2013 and has since led the PCF Mobile Services product team through a successful product launch. We’re excited to have his Product Management expertise on the data team now, and he will be based in our Palo Alto office.

He’ll also work closely with Michael Cucchi to ensure that product management and product marketing teams are more closely 
aligned.

I’d like to close out this message acknowledging the extraordinary efforts from the data engineering, product management and product marketing teams driving our imminent launches of PHD3, HAWQ 1.3, GPDB 4.3.5 and Gemfire OSS. Thank you!
