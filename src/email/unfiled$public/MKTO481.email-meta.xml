    <subject>Introducing Casper ll</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello to all Pivotal employees!
For those of you that clicked on the link for Casper enrollment invitation, thank you for assisting Pivotal IT with modernizing our management of Pivotal computers. We are continuing the rollout of Casper which will ensure our machines and documents remain secure. We currently have 500 machines enrolled and are well on our way to protecting our laptops and desktops. 

Windows Users: 
Earlier this week we became aware of a bug that resulted in some Windows users receiving incompatible installation binaries. IT has identified the issue and will have this resolved early next week. At that time you will receive instructions on how to proceed. In the case of installation problems please contact the support desk via email askit@gopivotal.com &lt;mailto:askIT@gopivotal.com&gt;.

 Mac Users: 
Some Mac users received a security certificate warning, and 
did not proceed further. We applaud your security diligence. Fear not, this issue has been resolved. The web site has an updated certificate. We encourage you to enroll your computer as soon as possible by clicking on the link you received in the email entitled â€œ Casper Enrollment Invitation&quot;.

The installation of Casper is mandatory for all Pivotal Employees and Contractors. 

 However, if you are a VMware, or EMC employee and are working on a computer issued by either of these companies, you are not required to enroll your machine into Casper and you may ignore this request. If you have already accepted the invitation and enrolled an EMC, or VMware computer, there is no risk to your computer by being enrolled in the Pivotal Casper system. 

 As we move forward with Casper, you will receive more information about the advantages of enrolling with this 
new tool.
 
Regards, 

Chris Curtis
