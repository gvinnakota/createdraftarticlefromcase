    <subject>The New Pivotal Patent Award Program</subject>
    <textOnly>Colleagues,

Iâ€™m pleased to announce a new patent award program for Pivotal employees.

Effective January 1, 2015, Pivotal will reward employees $1,500 for each patent application filed, $3,000 for each individual patent issued, and $10,000 for an 
employee that is an inventor on 10 US patents issued while a Pivotal employee.

Pivotal seeks the protection that patents offer for certain functions and processes key to our business strategy, and a patent award program encourages engagement in the patent 
process.

As we move to an open source-based business model, our patent strategy will include protecting both Pivotal proprietary technology, and certain technologies and processes of the open source communities that we are part of.

You can find 
details on the Patent Award Program, FAQs and Pivotal guidelines for filing patents on our Legal site &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/pivotal-legal---intellectual-property/patents&gt; on Inside Pivotal.

If you 
have any questions around our patent program, please reach out to Cyrus Wadia in Legal, at cwadia@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:cwadia@pivotal.io&gt;.</textOnly>
