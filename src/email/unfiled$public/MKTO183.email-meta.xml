&gt;&gt; Taking a Moment to Reflect

 I just left a Pivotal One Demo Session (a sneak preview of what we can expect at the launch next week), where Paul commented that we should all step back a moment and reflect on how far we’ve come already. In that moment, folks may have felt a sense of accomplishment, that their hard work was paying off, that we’re coming together as one team, that we’re making a difference. I felt proud.

 This edition of the biweekly Pivotal Newsletter showcases more of the accomplishments, hard work, and team building that are occurring companywide, including in Global Solutions, MPP Database &amp; Platform Engineering, Marketing, IT, and the Analytics 
Workbench team.

 Don’t forget to tune into next week’s special announcements &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/theplatform&gt; on November 12 at 10 a.m. PT!

Pivotal Solutions—What’s Going On in the Solutions Group!

 The Pivotal Solutions team represents Pivotal’s Industry General Managers, and consists of a group of team members that are building solutions to drive adoption of Pivotal technology. Our charter is to co-innovate transformational or disruptive go-to-market solutions within strategic market segments or around progressive business disciplines, with the goal of driving investment in Pivotal technology and services. We are currently working on multiple transformational solutions.

RTI for Telco
 One key initiative is our effort to manage early access for Real-Time Intelligence (RTI) for Telco, an important solution for Pivotal in the telecommunications industry. The RTI for Telco solution—which includes our Gemfire, Spring, and Rabbit technologies—is developed by Jeff Nick’s Solutions R&amp;D team and taken to market by Paul Davey and Joe Babic.

Pivotal and 
RSA
 Security Analytics is a tremendous use case for the Pivotal stack, and we couldn’t ask for a more powerful validation of our technology than a commitment from the world leader in security, RSA, to leverage Pivotal HD and HAWQ. Pivotal HD will provide the foundation for the RSA Security Analytics Warehouse. This foundation enables RSA and Pivotal to create a Security IT Data Lake by leveraging the power of our joint technologies.

 We are working toward tighter alignment between our product roadmap and integration. We will continue to evolve relationships at the local, regional, and theater level. We will also continue to make sure messaging is crisp and consistent. Our customers expect us to work together, and we agree.

 The Pivotal team is encouraged by initial momentum triggered by early customers, including Kaiser, Siemens, American Express, and Visa. In addition, we have great pipeline deals across many industries, including financials, manufacturing, and insurance. Pivotal is working closely with the RSA team in other theaters as well, including a joint GTM message with a major systems integrator in the UK. Each of these early deals leverage the IT Data Lake as the primary source to maintain the complete set of information used for security analytics and intelligence. They also represent great momentum around the Pivotal Business Data Lake concept, which is achieving traction in the market.

 Did you know that selling a solution will impact your sales cycle by increasing total deal size, decreasing time to close, facilitating the ability to sell 
directly to the business, or all of the above? Let us &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/file/d/0B_v9Ff-J-1pBUm44OWFZLWpNRW8&gt; know how we can help!

A Fun and Exciting Year for MPP Database &amp; Platform!

 2013 kicked off with a close collaboration with the Hadoop R&amp;D team to produce HAWQ, our industry-leading SQL engine for Hadoop. The innovations brought to the Hadoop market by HAWQ have captured the imagination (and business) of many. Implementations are currently underway at such customers as American Express, Visa and, of course, General Electric.

 It would have been a mistake, seeing this commercial success, to let our foot off the gas. Instead, we put together an aggressive release schedule for our next-generation query optimizer, ORCA, targeting HAWQ. Released within HAWQ in Q3, ORCA opens up a whole new class of workload for Hadoop users, ensuring that we maintain thought leadership within the industry.

 Pivotal Greenplum Database has been firing on all cylinders, as seen from its stellar sales results this year. The combination of predictable, rapid releases; iterative and agile delivery; close collaboration with the field and customer engineering; and genuine innovation around predictive analytics, reliability, and advanced functionality has cemented GPDB’s reputation as a top-tier data 
warehousing product. Having lived and breathed GPDB since early 2006, I couldn’t be more proud of what our all-star R&amp;D team has achieved.

 With the recent release of DCA 2.0.2, we now add another point of differentiation to our Hadoop offering: a Hadoop appliance. The team worked night and day throughout Q3 to deliver what will clearly be an important product for our sales team, particularly in the public sector.

 Soon we’ll be releasing the results of another close collaboration, the objective this time being integration of Pivotal HD 
into Cloud Foundry. Early response from the market has surpassed what were already high expectations on my part. This year will no doubt have a thrilling finale!

Get to Know Your Colleagues…Through Music?

Back in July, at the very first Corporate Marketing team meeting, I asked everyone to name the last two songs they 
had listened to—on purpose. Everyone laughed at the request, but I was sincerely interested. I wanted a quick and fun way to get to know my teammates that had nothing to do with technology, their work history, or where they received an MBA. The responses were enlightening, enjoyable and surprising. Here are a few examples: 


 - “I Could Be the One” – Aviici vs Nicky Romero
 - &quot;Murder in the City&quot; – Avett Brothers
 - “Too Much Pressure” – The Selecter
 - “Hallelujah Anyway” – Candi Staton
 - “That’s Life” – Frank Sinatra
 - “Learn to Fly” – Foo Fighters
 - “Born to Be Wild” – Steppenwolf
 - “Oh, Tatiana” – Superhuman Happiness
 - “Flying Rock Song” – The Backyardigans
 - “Such Great Heights” – The Postal Service
 - “I Wanna Be Like You” – Disney’s The Jungle Book


I made a point to listen to the songs that I wasn’t familiar with and found that I instantly had a greater appreciation of my colleagues—with just a quick view into their musical taste.

 I then used a demo app from EchoNest (one of my favorite data companies) to see if these diverse songs shared any common characteristics. It turns out that all but one was written in a major key and all of the songs shared the same time signature, 4/4. Most of the songs trended positive on the EchoNest valence (positive or negative) scale. Hmm, interesting…

 While I didn’t derive any data-driven conclusions from these facts, I do know that this “song exercise” proved to be a great team-building activity that made a difference. By the way, at the same meeting I also learned that a number of team members raise chickens. I decided not to investigate that piece of information any further!

 Members of the Corporate Marketing team include David Oro, Michael Weir, Matt Stodolnic, Chloe Jackson, Paul Santos, Christina Deex, Susan Beyer, Julie Mercurio, Dararith Ourk, Tamao Nakahara, Alison McCauley, 
Katherine McGreal, Mica Tee, Phil Reay, Katherine Xavier, Amy Welch, Mark Baars, Giorgio Besso, Lauren Volpi, and Avi Orenstein.

 Note: As we head into 2014, I&apos;m looking forward to working on Pivotal Labs marketing with Imtiaz Jaffer (from Xtreme labs) and team, as well as Pivotal 
Tracker marketing with Ronan Dunlop!

At Pivotal, I…
 Am the Engagement Manager for the Analytics Workbench (AWB) team and the Program Manager for the Technical Operations team.

You can find me…
 At the 
San Mateo, California, office.

Currently, I’m working on…
 Onboarding various projects onto the AWB &lt;http://www.analyticsworkbench.com/&gt;. During the month of October, the AWB team, along with Mellanox (one of our partners), converted the 1,000-node cluster from InfiniBand to 40-Gig Ethernet and back to InfiniBand in just a few days. In addition to University College London, in November we will be onboarding four more universities onto the cluster: University of Toronto, University of California San Diego, University of Florida and Dokuz Eylul University. The cluster topology now includes GPDB, GPHD 1.2, and Pivotal HD 1.0.3.

In my spare time…
 I love to read and cuddle with my cats.

Something you probably don’t know about me…
 I enjoy tuning SQL queries.

To me, Pivotal…
 Has an opportunity to redefine how enterprise companies do business. By building components that integrate seamlessly together, we can provide a simpler mechanism to process and analyze the large amounts of data that businesses are receiving.
