PIVOTAL NEWSLETTER
 Vol. 2, No. 11










 









EDITOR WELCOME

 Chief of Staff, Products







Plenty to do

 With so much to do, we all pitch in where we can. When we started this newsletter back on October 24, 2013, our Head of Communications, David Oro, committed to having a writer take it over as soon as he could hire some top talent. Now, 16 editions later (who’s counting?), I am pleased to announce that we have a new Newsletter Editor, Stephen Casale. Welcome to Pivotal, Steve!

 Speaking of pitching in, congratulations to everyone who’s been involved with Morgan Stanley – they just named Pivotal as a Co-Recipient of the firm’s annual “Innovation Award,” which recognizes the most progressive tech 
startup in the industry. Past recipients include Jive, Cloudera, VMware, Varonis, and others. Fantastic achievement everyone!

 This edition of the Pivotal Newsletter is filled with leaders who have plenty to do to help make Pivotal successful. We hear about all the activity in EMEA in the Business Update, Application Fabric success in the Product Update, a growing Palo Alto Pivotal Labs business in the Agile Update, and a team’s focus on making us all feel connected, engaged and valued in the People Update.

 
I’ll end my last Editor Welcome with some long-overdue thanks to a group of awesome folks in Marketing (Michael Weir, Shannon Dunn, Katherine Xavier, Christina Deex) for helping me publish this newsletter every two weeks and also a big thank you to Scott Yara, Bill Cook, Richard Snee and 
Joe Militello, who championed making this newsletter a reality. Thank you all for reading!

Plenty to do in EMEA

 It’s been awhile since I have provided an update for the Newsletter, so we have lots to share. The team arrived back from the WWSKO event &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/sales-kick-off-2014&gt; in February with a palpable sense of optimism, coupled with a steely focus on our key sales 
plays. We needed to rebalance the pipeline while keeping revenue at or above our company goals. Through some outstanding team and individual performances, we managed to achieve our aims. Special mention to Tony Parker and the whole Vodafone team for an outstanding Q1 contribution on Real Time Intelligence (RTI) &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/solutions/telecommunications&gt;, not only in revenue, but account 
penetration. It seems a long time ago, but the press they achieved at Mobile World Congress &lt;http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/&gt; in February was nothing short of outstanding.

Region Trends
 In 
addition, last quarter, we saw our first Cloud Foundry deals in Swisscom and Axel Springer (a German Media company). There is a definite focus shift in the marketplace to the “Pivotal Way,” so we are expecting big things for Q2 and the rest of the year!

 It is perhaps worth mentioning a typical example of the shift to the 3rd Platform, which is shifting in our favor. Unilever, a global Consumer goods company with over 167 thousand employees worldwide, actually cold called us! Having learned about our approach, their CTO wanted to see if we were “real”…so he came to see us. This Pivotal Labs engagement will be a feather in the cap for our London office and I’m sure it will pull through Pivotal CF as a result. This is by no means an isolated example, with UBS and others approaching us. Whether the initial interest is Pivotal Labs or Pivotal CF-based, it’s clear our whole portfolio is applicable in the market.

Strategic Partnerships
 Growing in EMEA requires partners and you can’t mention strategic partnerships without talking about 
our family – the EMC Federation &lt;http://emcfederation.com/&gt; of companies (EMC, Pivotal, RSA and VMware). EMC’s Adrian McDonald kindly invited Pivotal to their leadership training session in Paris earlier this month. With over 300 EMC leaders in one room, we participated in a leadership panel with Pivotal receiving special praise for our partnership-friendly approach. EMC and Pivotal in EMEA have a dedicated team being hired to address the DCA/DLA, supported by over 70 “Pivotal Champions” across the theater. Together, we are a formidable force.

 Capgemini is another important partner in EMEA. With a series of weighty deals in pipeline, our relationship goes from strength to strength. Earlier this quarter, Capgemini began using Pivotal Big Data Suite to provide a platform for clients in the Netherlands. We’ve also seen the first formal Business Data Lake RFP – from an account for which Capgemini acted as a strategic advisor to the client on approach, and introduced the Pivotal team to key stakeholders.

 In the UK we celebrated our first significant win together and also 
created the only Big Data solution available on the UK Government G-Cloud &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government_G-Cloud&gt; procurement process. Possibly most notably, however, is that Pivotal and Capgemini own the Google search term “Data Lake.” After Forbes, the key hits are the content that Capgemini and Pivotal created together.

 Check out the video &lt;http://www.enterprisemanagement360.com/video/em360focus-business-data-lake/&gt; of an interview with Steve Jones. He is responsible for defining and growing the work between Capgemini and Pivotal, including establishing a Center of Excellence in Bangalore and Pune, as well as business development across the Americas and EMEA.

UK Policy Exchange Roundtable
 Over the last few 
months, Pivotal has been recognized by the UK Government and we are playing a role in how it approaches the digital world. Pivotal hosted a roundtable discussion &lt;http://newsblog.emc.co.uk/reinventing-government-preparing-a-2015-technology-manifesto-on-storify/&gt; at our London offices and we are also providing thought leadership and 
guidance for a Government Digital Policy report entitled How Technology Can Reinvent Government. The Head of Digital Governmentand the Director of Innovation at the Cabinet Office, as well as technology journalists from The Times, BBC and Telegraph, attended the roundtable discussion. The following week, we also had the CEOs of several UK Government agencies in Palo Alto for a “Valley Tour.”


Pivotal EMEA on 
the Road
 We’ve been busy on the road, with too many activities to mention. However, Big Data Paris &lt;http://www.bigdataparis.com/&gt; is worth a special call out because it coincided in the April launch of Pivotal Big Data Suite in EMEA. As a Platinum sponsor of the event, we also received headline billing.


 We have plenty of work to do and continue to share the Pivotal 
message and raise awareness through a number of speaking engagements across the region – including in Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, Qatar and Germany this month. Paul Maritz is currently in the EMEA region, with a number of engagements in Dubai and South Africa.

 Finally, I’d like to welcome all the new employees in EMEA. The team continues to grow as we attract top talent across the region to align with and surpass our goals!











PRODUCT UPDATE
Randy MacBlane
 VP Engineering, Application Fabric







Plenty to do in Application Fabric

 The Application Fabric team &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/913927-randymacblane/organization&gt; recently held a Spring Program 
Review covering all things Spring for the Java development community. This is a great way to familiarize yourself with Spring projects and includes live demos of both Spring Boot &lt;http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/&gt; and Spring XD &lt;http://projects.spring.io/spring-xd/&gt;. Spring Boot 1.0 recently went GA &lt;https://spring.io/blog/2014/04/01/spring-boot-1-0-ga-released&gt;, while the plan is to release Spring XD 1.0 in mid-July.

 In addition to Boot and XD, we’ve been hard 
at work on the Spring IO platform &lt;https://spring.io/platform&gt;, which brings together the core Spring APIs into a versioned and supported platform that gives developers a foundation for building modern applications. The platform distribution is comprised of 31 Spring projects, and set for GA in early June. You can learn more about Spring, Groovy and Grails at the SpringOne 2GX  &lt;https://2014.event.springone2gx.com/schedule&gt;conference in September.


 The team has also been in high gear on Q2 releases, such as RabbitMQ &lt;http://www.rabbitmq.com/&gt; 3. &lt;http://rabbitmq.docs.gopivotal.com/relnotes/release-notes-rabbitmq3.3.html&gt;3 &lt;http://rabbitmq.docs.gopivotal.com/relnotes/release-notes-rabbitmq3.3.html&gt;.0 &lt;http://rabbitmq.docs.gopivotal.com/relnotes/release-notes-rabbitmq3.3.html&gt; and 3.3.1 &lt;http://rabbitmq.docs.gopivotal.com/relnotes/release-notes-rabbitmq3.3.html#resolvedissues331&gt;, and Pivotal Web Server &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/products/pivotal-web-server&gt; 5.4 &lt;http://webserver.docs.gopivotal.com/relnotes/release-notes-web-server5.4.html&gt; (which includes mitigations for OpenSSL Heartbleed &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed&gt;). To make it easy for customers to demo, we’ve packaged all App Fabric products into an App Suite VM &lt;https://network.gopivotal.com/products/pivotal-app-suite-vapp&gt;, and for Sales, we’ve introduced an App 
Suite SKU – a simple, fast, one-SKU bundle that brings together what was once 300 separate SKUs.

Success With Big Names
 Technologies that we’ve introduced over the past year are finding success in the Field. Netflix is leveraging Spring Boot and has begun to speak publicly &lt;https://github.com/Netflix/asgard/issues/486#issuecomment-43157790&gt; about it. Boot is also being used in a Pivotal Labs’ engagement with Major League Baseball to develop a customer service application. The Pivotal Labs team provided great feedback that is now being incorporated into the Spring Boot roadmap.

 We’re very close to making Spring XD the ingest platform-of-choice for a top agribusiness manufacturer. A big thanks goes to the tireless Derek Beauregard, who was instrumental on a great POC that opened the doors. Stay tuned for more news on this and other successes!

 Finally, thanks to the hard work of Jerry Kuch, RabbitMQ is now 
available as a service on Google Compute Engine &lt;https://cloud.google.com/partners/technology-partners/compute-engine/&gt;, and mutual blog posts will follow soon.

Converging on Pivotal 
CF
 All roads eventually lead to the platform. While delivering the best programming platform has always been a top ambition of the Application Fabric team, delivery via the Pivotal One platform is equally important. To that end, we’ve recently released the tc Server Buildpack to Pivotal Network &lt;https://network.gopivotal.com/products/pivotal-cf&gt;, Spring Cloud 1.0 &lt;http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/&gt; and have also started on a project to bring Spring XD to Pivotal CF in earnest.











AGILE UPDATE
Ryan Richard
 Director, Pivotal Labs Palo Alto







Plenty to do at Pivotal Labs in Palo Alto

 Greetings from the newest Pivotal Labs office in Palo Alto! With our official opening event &lt;http://play.gopivotal.com/Pivotal-Presents-Fireside-Chat-Greylock.html&gt; happening tonight, we’re excited to make our mark in the valley that remains the world’s standard-bearer for outstanding innovation.

 We’re located within Pivotal’s Palo Alto facility. Having seeded the team with a small group of Pivots from the San Francisco office, we will continue growing the team over 2014. We have added two developers since we started here in January, with more candidates who have accepted offers starting soon – a testament to the allure of working for Pivotal when there are so many competitive companies looking for the best talent!

 Our first project was internal – helping the Pivotal Analytics team with product management and development. Our first client project has been with Nominum &lt;http://nominum.com/&gt;, a leader in DNS technology. If you’ve visited Pivotal’s Palo Alto facility recently, you’ve probably seen our client’s developers, product manager, and QA working with us in our office. Our third project is building a web-based user experience for HAWQ, to be used as a sales demo. We’re busy meeting with potential clients to spread the word about the great things that Pivotal Labs can do for them, so stay tuned for more project announcements.

 As for Pivotal Labs news in general, I’m pleased to announce that we’re sponsoring LAUNCH Beacon &lt;http://events.launch.co/beacon&gt; in New York City on June 16th. Beacon focuses on the intersection of retail, payments and locations, and will bring together some of the hottest emerging companies and disrupters in the space. We still have openings for attendees and speakers, so please share our sponsorship with anyone in your network that you think may be interested. More information and registration details can be found at http://events.launch.co/beacon &lt;http://events.launch.co/beacon&gt;, or email Imtiaz Jaffer &lt;mailto:ijaffer@pivotallabs.com&gt;, our Director of Marketing, for more information.



 








PEOPLE UPDATE
Joe Militello
 Vice President, People







Plenty to do in Employee Engagement

 Are you excited by Pivotal? Do you feel connected, engaged and valued? These are some of the questions that 
form the basis of my team’s approach to making Pivotal an exceptional place to work. Much of what we do is to answer those questions. We strive to make Pivotal a place where people feel they are part of a community – empowered to think big and make things happen.

 Employee engagement is something we start with and return to again and again for the people at Pivotal. While we have made some great strides, we have much more work ahead of us.

The New Performance Feedback Process
 With a focus on frequent dialogue and broad feedback, the performance feedback  &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/presentation/d/1kEhrDtuqNg5sVYNejama3xpSpWteRxwqdOCrhfhx3YU/edit#slide=id.g3871f3661_2_144&gt;methodology we’re introducing will allow everyone to have a voice. We’re giving something as important as development a bigger venue with more quality and timely feedback. Evolving towards a more substantive, authentic performance process will make it a more consistent part of work. We will do this by moving away from the more traditional annual assessments, performance ratings and stack rankings that can dilute those intentions.

Pivotal Powers People Tools
 We’re leveraging Pivotal’s deep product expertise to deliver key People 
apps that you’ll need and will enjoy using (What a novel thought!). We’re lining up initial apps for executive review and will partner with Pivotal Labs to develop them on Cloud Foundry.

 Similarly, we’re engaged with the Data Science team to gain better insights from data to support great employee experiences, and to foster diversity of 
thought.

 For those that may have missed other recent People updates here is a brief recap: 


 - New Pivotal Directory &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/document/d/1-zavcly01erMX--_EiTb4Rle1kZThylRPcYSP4vLvlk/edit&gt; – Find Pivotal people anywhere and new org charts 
 - Benefits Newsletter &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/document/d/1gKtfPMvd5BBuM_G-1Rh0oVqJKL7cxhWGKqzeRdjgntQ/edit&gt; – The next edition is coming soon on Inside Pivotal
 - Glow &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/document/d/1FBXNtmuLuWS1GQMnn7uxhXd2miPJN0s_J9qFw-77vxY/edit&gt; – New Health &amp; Wellness benefits 


It’s exciting to be backed by so much unique talent and technology, and I know it will continue to help make Pivotal an awesome place to work.

 Joe











HELLO, MY NAME IS…
Matt Neglay
 Principal Data Engineer, Pivotal Data Labs







At Pivotal, I…
 am a Data Engineer in Pivotal Data Labs (PDL). I think that means I’m supposed to be engineering some data, but I don’t know what that would look like, so I usually just end up helping customers with the data they already have.

You can find me…
 usually splitting my time between real home 
in Denver and work home in Bentonville, Arkansas. Why, you ask? I bet the next point clears that up…

Currently, I am working on…
 Walmart. The Pivotal story has been well received down there. We’re hoping to have the full Pivotal Big Data Suite in place there by the end of the year – at scale, no less! We’ve got a great team. If we could just get Walmart to move their headquarters to Manhattan, it’d be perfect.

In my spare time…
I moved from Seattle to Denver 15 months ago, so I’m still getting used to going outside without Gore-Tex. When I do go outside, I try to stay active.

Something you probably don’t know about me…
The picture of me is from the top of Mount Evans. It is one of the easiest 14’ers in Colorado. But, it’s still really hard for a 41 year old who spends most of his days typing. 

To me Pivotal…
 Is the right place at the right time.
