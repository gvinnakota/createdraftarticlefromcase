Leadership

 This week I had the privilege of learning more about our Federation &lt;http://siliconangle.com/blog/2013/06/02/3-things-we-learned-about-emcs-growing-federation-at-emc-world-2013/&gt; (EMC, VMware, Pivotal, and RSA), a business model that was only announced six months ago at EMC World. At the Federation Leadership meeting on Monday, Joe Tucci said there are two key characteristics of great leaders: 1. Humility and 2. Will to Succeed.

 This edition of the biweekly Pivotal Newsletter is filled with stories of great leadership; from trailblazing deals in the Worldwide Field Organization, to 2014 plans in Product Marketing, to enhanced customer experiences in Field Engineering / Early Access Programs, 
to a successful team effort in Solutions R&amp;D.

 Hopefully you’ve all read Paul’s Pivotal Mission for 2014 &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/mission-2014&gt; by now. This is going to be quite a year for Pivotal as we pursue the “new platform for a new era” opportunity. We can do this – not only do we belong to a Federation of phenomenal leaders, we have demonstrated time and time again that we know how to support one another and make great things happen!

“Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it&apos;s thinking of yourself less.”—C. S. Lewis

Trailblazers

2013 was an amazing year for Pivotal! With the launch of HAWQ in February &lt;http://www.emc.com/about/news/press/2013/20130225-04.htm&gt;, Pivotal Gemfire XD and Pivotal Data Dispatch in October, and Pivotal CF and Pivotal One in November &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/press-center/11122013-pivotal-one&gt;, the Product team has done an unbelievable job laying the foundation for the core elements of our 2014 offerings. I&apos;d like to highlight a few of the trailblazing deals done in 2013 that define the standard we should all aspire to in 2014. 

 - Department of Justice – Michael Parks closed the largest Hadoop Appliance win in Pivotal History with a $5 million Q3 booking.
 - Vodafone – Tony Parker and the RTI team delivered over $3 million in bookings while co-innovating the RTI solution.
 - TIM Wireless (Brazil) – Ana Claudia Oliveria closed the first Hadoop win in South America and locked up a CDR archive project for a $1.3 Million booking.
 - NBC Universal – Craig Nowell closed a &gt;$1 Million Pivotal Labs project that was the first deal to also include Pivotal software products. A model we should all seek to copy in 2014.
 - Kaiser – Diana Conner and the Data Science Team are helping Kaiser modernize their data infrastructure via Pivotal data fabric and data science, while closing multiple million-dollar bookings.
 - Telecom Digital Ventures – Mark Randall led the first APJ win for Pivotal CF and Pivotal Data Fabric as TDV is building their next-gen Smart Data Business on Pivotal technology.
 - Monsanto – Brian Lock has landed Pivotal at the center of the next generation of farming with a &gt;$8 million booking.
 - Verizon – Andrew Ettinger closed the first Pivotal CF win for &gt;$7million before the product even GA&apos;ed. Verizon will be launching a public PaaS offering built on Pivotal CF in early 2014.


I’m looking forward to more in 2014!

PRODUCT UPDATE
Todd Paoletti
 Vice President, Product Marketing







Pivotal … simplified.

The Product Marketing team’s charter in 2014 is threefold: 

 - Articulate Clear, Compelling Vision: we will showcase what’s possible at Pivotal and why it matters, establish the journey on which to take our customers, and marry the utility of Big Data and PaaS.
 - Establish Credibility: we will prove ourselves technically, empower our customers, and tell their stories.
 - Enable Sales Velocity and Scale: we will create disruptive and scalable consumption models, and ignite the Federation (Pivotal, EMC, VMware, RSA) sales channel.

 This is going to be an exciting year!

 The key will be simplicity: 


 - GTM strategy and focus areas for 2014 … simplified.
 - Packaging, pricing, and consumption models … simplified.
 - Field enablement and assets … simplified.
 - ROI, demos, positioning, and value proposition content … simplified.


Right now, we’re focusing on building a team and standing all of this up. The team works out of our San Francisco office (for the most part) and consists of Mike Cucchi, Nikesh Shah, Susheel Kaushik, Cate Zovod, and Sophia Tseng.

 I joined Pivotal and signed up for this challenge last quarter. It was a no-brainer, given the company’s potential and my background in open source, startups, cloud, and business intelligence. Previously, I was at Akamai in various product management, product marketing, and business development roles.

 I’ll end with a shameless plug: I’m hiring, so if you have recommendations for great hires in product marketing and operations, please contact me directly: tpaoletti@gopivotal.com &lt;mailto:tpaoletti@gopivotal.com&gt;

2013 was Incredible — 2014 will be even better.

 In partnership with the GTM teams, Field Engineering has made significant progress with Early 
Access and Emerging Technologies. This progress has created enhanced customer experiences and tighter alignment between our field and product teams. Here are a few areas of interest: 



 - Pivotal CF &quot;Sandbox&quot; Environments – Field Engineers and the Professional Services Organization can now reserve vSphere clusters to practice, install and interact with Pivotal CF, Pivotal AX, Pivotal HD for Pivotal CF, Pivotal RabbitMQ for Pivotal CF, and other 
technologies. These environments will also be used for immersion training (organized by Fred Melo). Soon to be added is a persisted, Internet-accessible (i.e., no EMC VPN required!) Pivotal CF demo system.
 - Pivotal HD / HAWQ Hallway Testing – Over 40 hallway tests were held in 2013 with FE and PSO participation. More tests are being planned in Q1 to test security, high availability capability, and more.
 - RTI4T Bootcamp Session – The first of these was held in the UK in December by Tobias Karlsson. This had great feedback and is designed to support initial activity at accounts such as Vodafone and Telstra.
 - GPDB Orca Early Access Program – Tremendous performance gains have been seen on query workloads identified from PoCs and existing customers. There is still room for customers to be added in January to the Orca EAP.
 - Pivotal CF &quot;Hands On&quot; Workshop – The first half-day Pivotal CF &quot;Hands on Workshop&quot; was delivered to several customers at once by Brian Jimmerson, Andrew Ripka, Scott Kahler, and supported by Matt Stine.


If you’re interested in any of these programs, feel free to reach out to me: arutherford@gopivotal.com &lt;mailto:arutherford@gopivotal.com&gt;. Most of these you’ll also find posts about on Socialcast @FieldEngineering &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/groups/79408-fieldengineering&gt; with more detail.

Team Effort to Release RTI4T

 We are very pleased to announce the engineering release of Real Time Intelligence for Telecom (RTI4T) Version 1.0.0.0! 
RTI4T is a product evolved from pioneering work by the Pivotal PSO team for Vodafone UK. The initial focus is to use sensor data (from cell phones) to create Mobile Marketing opportunities for telecom network providers and their partners. Stay tuned for more details on sales and future versions of RTI4T.

 RTI4T represents the collective success of many teams across our company. The delivery of product and revenue in 2013 is a shining example of what can be achieved when outstanding people come together united in a common goal and desire to win for Pivotal.

 First, we recognize the immense effort made by the EMEA Field team in delivering the initial wins at 
Vodafone. Flying under an EMC flag, but delivering as VMware, this team took on IBM on their home turf and won a streaming analytics RFP to become the preferred global supplier to Vodafone. Especially noteworthy was the work of Vinesh Manoharan, who created the initial codebase and persuaded Vodafone we could deliver. This enabled Tony Parker to produce a sequence of commercial wins that have created the RTI4T market entry point. Finally, we want to thank Julian Bailey and Beth Brown. Julian was able to keep us on top during many extremely hairy stages of service delivery, including when IBM tried to assert ownership and support of our solution by claiming they knew how to build it themselves from our products.

 Second, we wish to give special thanks to 
George Chitouras as Product Engineering Manager, as well as the entire R&amp;D engineering team. We also express gratitude to Steve Watson’s PSO team for their strong contributions. Together, R&amp;D and PSO were able to join forces and work as one team last quarter. We also want to thank Randy MacBlane for stepping up with scarce resources from his App Fabric commercial delivery team at a critical time. The Spring, Rabbit and GemFire teams have also provided help whenever asked. Finally, thanks to Johnny Scarborough, Eoghan Dolan and others for standing up RTI4T 24/7 product support and enabling Julian to keep IBM locked out.

 Finally, we want to recognize the contributions from Field Solutions and Field Engineering. In extremely challenging circumstances, John Jahnke, Paul Davey, Joe Babic, and others have all worked tirelessly and enthusiastically to promote this business case around the world.

 On behalf of Alexis Richardson (whose personal contributions as PM have been 
instrumental to our achievements thus far) and myself, sincere thanks to all!











HELLO, MY NAME IS…
Nitin Lamba
 Product Manager, Data Fabric







At Pivotal, I…
 lead product management for monitoring and managing Data Fabric offerings (a.k.a. Pivotal Data Tools).

You can find me…
 mostly in the Palo Alto, CA office and sometimes in San Francisco.

Currently, I’m working on…
 helping customers operationalize Pivotal Hadoop Distribution (PHD) through 
Command Center. In the past few months, I have been at Visa&apos;s headquarters with Ayush Parashar, Bharath Maryada, and Bob Geiger to help take Visa into production on their security analytics project (using various logs to find security anomalies in users, applications, etc.). We have a great winning team helping customers every day!

In my spare time…
 I like to spend time with my family. And if I’m lucky, I get time to tinker with stuff - electronics, appliances, HVAC, furniture – mostly to repair it. :)

Something you probably don’t know about me…
 is that I’ve worked with systems on space station, airplanes, refineries, army bases, high-rise buildings, and data centers!

To me, Pivotal…
 is a great 
opportunity to bring together key technologies to help enterprise businesses accelerate value delivery. Pivotal is also where we work together and push limits to realize this dream!
