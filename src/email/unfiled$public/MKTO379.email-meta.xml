    <subject>Upcoming Pivotal Guest wireless password change</subject>
    <textOnly>At the Worldwide Sales Kickoff event (WWSKO) a couple of weeks ago, our executive team laid out the plan for 2014 and challenged all of us to Make It Happen. In order to keep this message front-and-center in our thoughts and actions, we will be changing the Pivotal Guest WIFI password to makeithappen.
 
This change will be made this Sunday evening, March 2nd, and will impact the following Pivotal office locations:



 - San Francisco, CA
 - Palo Alto, CA
 - Santa Monica, CA
 - New York City, NY
 - Boulder, CO
 - Denver, CO
 - Bentonville, AR
 - Toronto
 - London



As we bring up WIFI at additional locations in the coming weeks such as in Shanghai and Beijing, these new sites will also follow this standard.
 
If you have any questions about this change, please email askIT@gopivotal.com &lt;mailto:askIT@gopivotal.com&gt; or ask@pivotallabs.com &lt;mailto:ask@pivotallabs.com&gt;.
 
Regards,
