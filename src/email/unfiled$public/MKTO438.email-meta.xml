    <subject>FINAL NOTICE - ACTION REQUIRED: New Pivotal SSO - Set up your account by Friday, March 21</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello to all Pivotal employees!
We&apos;re sending a final reminder in case you missed the original email or haven&apos;t had a chance to set up your Okta account yet. You&apos;ll need to create your Okta account by 6pm PT on March 21, 2014, or you&apos;ll be locked out of your gopivotal.com &lt;http://gopivotal.com/&gt; account when we start using Okta for Google access.

We&apos;re sending a new activation link to everyone who hasn&apos;t signed up yet. If you don&apos;t see the new activation email, search your Inbox, Spam, and filtered messages for the subject line &quot;Account password reset&quot;, and email askIT@gopivotal.com &lt;mailto:askIT@gopivotal.com&gt; if you 
still aren&apos;t able to find it. The full announcement is posted on the Pivotal IT wiki &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/pivotal-it/pivotal-single-sign-on&gt;. 




What you need to do by 6pm PT, Friday, March 21


 - Pivotal IT sent you an activation email at your gopivotal.com &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/&gt; address (Subject: &quot;Account password reset&quot;).  Click the Activation/Password Reset Link in the body of the email to set up your Pivotal Okta account. Detailed instructions are on the Pivotal IT wiki &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/pivotal-it/pivotal-single-sign-on&gt;.
 - Because Google will now use Okta to sign you into your gopivotal.com &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/&gt; account, you must set up your Okta account before 6pm PT, March 21, 2014.  If you haven&apos;t set up your account by then, you may be locked out of your accounts.


Google Service Disruption During the Change


 - It&apos;s tough to change the wheels on a moving vehicle, so we&apos;ll need to shut down work.gopivotal.com &lt;http://work.gopivotal.com/&gt; (and access to Google Apps) starting at 6pm PT Friday, March 21.
 - Service should be restored by 10am PT Saturday, March 22, but there may be some additional brief downtime for the rest of the weekend.

 - Managers: If you have people out on vacation who won&apos;t be able to create their Okta accounts before the cutover, please reach out to askIT@gopivotal.com &lt;mailto:askIT@gopivotal.com&gt; 
as soon as they&apos;re back.  The IT team will work with you and your reports to set up their Okta access.
 - After the cutover date, you may need to update your passwords on mobile devices.  Your Google Apps password will be the same as your Okta password.


If you have any questions about this change, you can email askIT@gopivotal.com &lt;mailto:askIT@gopivotal.com&gt; from any email address.
