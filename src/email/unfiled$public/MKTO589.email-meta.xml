    <textOnly>Spring User Group
We are glad to announce that we will host our monthly Spring event on Thursday, May 8th, in Bras Basah from 7PM to 9PM. The topic this month will “Web frameworks for Java”.

The Java ecosystem has tons of web frameworks available: Spring MVC, JSF, Struts 2, GWT, Wicket, and so on. Why do we have so many options? Which of them are the most widely used today? What is the trend for tomorrow?

Michael Isvy (Pivotal) will go through the history of Java web frameworks in the past 10 years. We will also have Salahuddin and Srikanth from ThoughtWorks will then take you for a ride of &quot;Test-Driven Spring MVC live coding&quot;.
