    <subject>Your Alumni Discount for DataBeat/Data Science Summit</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

As a Data Science Summit alumnus, we invite you to join us again on December 4-5, 2013 in Redwood City, CA. We are thrilled to partner with DataBeat to present this year&apos;s Data Science Summit. If you have not registered yet, please use the exclusive Alumni discount &lt;http://databeat2013.eventbrite.com/?discount=DSSalum&gt; to get 25% off the current registration price.


At the Data Science Summit, you&apos;ll meet the new breed of data scientists from companies such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Domo and NYSE Euronext. This is your opportunity to explore what some of the world&apos;s most innovative companies are doing, and learn how data science can have a direct impact on your organization’s success.

Sessions will focus on real world experiences. We’ll peel back the covers to examine the benefits that more data brings to individuals and companies alike. You&apos;ll get an understanding of how to approach and utilize data science today to create real business value. 

If you are a data scientist, executive, journalist, or academic focused on how to use data to enhance real business and real lives, then the Data Science Summit is the event for you.


I hope to see you in December,
Richard Snee
Event Co-Chair
CMO, Pivotal
