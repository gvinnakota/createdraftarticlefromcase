    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Weâ€™re sorry you were unable to attend the Pivotal Big Data Roadshow this week in Boston. The hands-on workshop gave our attendees an opportunity to learn how to transform their data infrastructure with Spring HD, Gemfire, Pivotal HD and Pivotal HAWQ in their environment. 

Although you missed the event, we wanted to make the presentation slides &lt;http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/big-data-roadshow&gt; available to you and invite you to read more about the events of the day on our blog &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/big-data-pivotal/products/pivotal-data-roadshow-a-view-from-the-road&gt;. 

Thank you again for joining us! For upcoming events visit us at  &lt;http://pivotal.io/&gt;http://pivotal.io/news-events#events &lt;http://pivotal.io/news-events&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;a style=&gt;. We are looking forward to seeing soon!
