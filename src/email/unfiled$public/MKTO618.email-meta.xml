    <subject>Reminder - Deal Desk Process for Non-Standard Proposals</subject>
    <textOnly>Global Field Operations Team, 

As you saw in the May Field Operations communication, Deal Desk process improvements are on the way, which will maximize Sales Management visibility, boost deal value, decrease the time to approval and reduce the possibility of end of quarter issues.

In the interim, we have created a temporary process that we believe will help bridge the gap from the current state to the Q3 process.Effective immediately, all reps will be required to follow the steps below before they can make any non-standard proposals (this includes discounts greater than the rep level).


 - STEP 1 Ensure that your SFDC Opportunity reflects what you are going to propose to the customer
 - STEP 2 Download and complete the Deal Desk Approval Form &lt;https://drive.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/file/d/0B7uO4XIa64ANNXVTLUZhNDY3SzlBQVR3Y1pXa1Nmc2F5eHV3/edit?usp=sharing&gt;. Attach it to the SFDC Opportunity
 - Step 3 Contact the Deal Desk using @deal_desk in the Opportunityâ€™s chatter feed



The Deal Desk will turn around non-standard proposal approvals within 48 hours. If you have any questions regarding the process please feel free to contact the deal desk at pivotal-deal-desk@gopivotal.com &lt;mailto:pivotal-deal-desk@gopivotal.com&gt;.

Thanks again,
Greg Stroud &amp; The Pivotal Deal Desk Team</textOnly>
