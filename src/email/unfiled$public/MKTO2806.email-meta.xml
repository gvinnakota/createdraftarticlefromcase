    <textOnly>Team,

It’s never been a more exciting time to be part of Pivotal.

While I’m very confident that we’ve positioned our company and our sales teams for an outstanding year and future, I want us all to understand and feel comfortable 
with what’s changing, and what isn’t.

What doesn’t change is our work with customers and prospects. I and other leaders have reached out to our customers to assure them that all we do has not changed.

Our Geo leaders will be setting up sessions with your teams and are available to answer any questions.

In the meantime, I’ve attached these FAQs &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/document/d/12Tl22vNitHitNhQFSLpM4byfglZUpkNe3AjFP84bkc8/edit?usp=sharing&gt; to help you message this leadership transition with your customers and partners.

I look forward to connecting with everyone in the coming weeks!

Best,</textOnly>
