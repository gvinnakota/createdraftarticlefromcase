    <subject>Announcing Two Upcoming Town Halls - Please Join Us</subject>
    <textOnly>Team,

I wanted to reach out and encourage all of you to attend the Pivotal Town Hall that we’re hosting at 9:00 A.M. Pacific, on Thursday, 30 October. The breadth of initiatives and speed with which we’ve accomplished many of them is testament to all that we’ve done since we last gathered in April. 

Many of you are eager to get the latest view into our business, and the leadership team is equally excited to 
engage and outline the course we’ll set in 2015.

If you’re in the Bay Area, please join us live in Palo Alto. Like last time, we’ll webcast the event live from the Town Hall icon &lt;https://pivotal.okta.com/login/do-login&gt; on the Okta dashboard, and we’ll be hosting meeting groups in offices with event 
space. 

Please Join EMC CEO and Board on November 6
I’m also very pleased to invite you to meet with EMC CEO Joe Tucci and the EMC Board, for a Town Hall on Thursday, 6 November, in Palo Alto. The EMC Board has made it a practice to meet with employees wherever it convenes, and they have held these across the globe. 

We’re happy to host them in the Bay Area this time around. This is not a formal event predicated on specific news or announcements. It’s just a classic Town Hall and opportunity for Pivotal employees to hear from and engage with Joe Tucci and the EMC Board. This will also be broadcast live on Okta &lt;https://pivotal.okta.com/login/do-login&gt;.

Details - EMC Town Hall with Joe Tucci and Board
9:00 A.M. Pacific, Thursday, 6 November
Palo Alto Deer Creek Offices, and live webcast from Okta

We’re looking forward to seeing you all at both events.

Best,</textOnly>
