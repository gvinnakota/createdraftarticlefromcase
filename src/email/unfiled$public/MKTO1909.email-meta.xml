    <subject>Certify with Greenplum 4.3 -- Extended Support Period for 4.2</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-gpdb&gt;
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Over the years, Pivotal has introduced leading edge technology in products that provide enterprise wide solutions to our customersâ€™ information technology needs. As enterprise technology and customer requirements have evolved, so too have our products. In line with this evolution, Pivotal continues to develop, market and support Greenplum Database Software (GPDB) 4.3.x &lt;https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-gpdb&gt; and its subsequent maintenance releases. 

Certify with Greenplum 4.3
We have approximately 700 customers using GPDB, many of whom are successfully using our products together and will want to continue to use them as they upgrade to 4.3.x. They are actively reaching out to inquire about partner certification status with 4.3.x. If you have not already done so, we strongly urge you to certify your product with GPDB 4.3.x &lt;https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-gpdb&gt; as many of our customers rely on your certification to upgrade. Customers who upgrade to GPDB 4.3.x will receive the benefit of the latest features, functionality and bug fixes.

If you have already certified your product with GPDB 4.3.x, please contact our GPDB Product Manager, Bharath Sitaraman &lt;mailto:bsitaraman@pivotal.io&gt;, to update your certification status so we can communicate the same to your customers.

Extending Greenplum 4.2 Support Termination
We previously announced Termination of Support of 
Software Release for Greenplum Database software 4.2 series effective March 31, 2015 so that we can concentrate our efforts on the current technology. In order to allow customers additional time to implement this upgrade, we are providing a courtesy extension of support of Greenplum Database Software 4.2 family to September 30, 2015.

Questions? Email us &lt;mailto:bsitaraman@pivotal.io&gt;.

Thank you,
The Pivotal Team</textOnly>
