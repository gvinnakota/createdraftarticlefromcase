    <subject>Pivotal at M1 Summit - Thanks for Joining us!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Pivotal was proud to sponsor the M1 Summit &lt;http://m1summitnyc2015.splashthat.com/&gt; recently. As a continuing sponsor we find great value in meeting everyone and listening to the impactful talks.

We&apos;re pleased to share a recent keynote &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal-labs/p-o-v/the-secret-behind-silicon-valley&gt; given 
by Pivotal EVP, Rob Mee, on &quot;The Secret Behind Silicon Valley&quot;. This talk focuses on how software is disrupting economies and industries worldwide and how traditional approaches, paradigms, and processes need to change in order to compete in these modern times.

Also, we hope you had a chance to listen to our GM of Mobile Amar Varma at the M1 
summit on the session, &quot;How Mobile Will Transform the Next Enterprise Verticals‚Äù - if you missed the talk, it can be found here &lt;https://vimeo.com/129813827&gt;.

Thank you,
The Pivotal Team</textOnly>
