EDITOR WELCOME
 Milestones, Progress, Hills to Climb 
 Steve Casale &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1033819-stephencasale&gt;, Sr. Manager, Corporate Communications
Pivotal doings continue to garner praise from partners and customers alike. We got lots of attention at Strata + Hadoop &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/events/2014-strata-confrence-hadoop-world&gt;, where the head of GE’s Analytics Technology notes our instrumental role 
in bringing the industrial internet &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrRvLmIF0nI&amp;list=UUu3Ri8DI1RQLdVtU12uIp1Q&gt; to life. Earlier this month EMC CIO Vic Bhagat talked data lakes &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/big-data-pivotal/case-studies-2/an-interview-with-vic-bhagat-emcs-cio-and-nominee-to-cio-magazines-cio-100-list&gt; and Pivotal’s key role in this emerging data architecture. Pivotal also released the Cloud Foundry Foundation bylaws &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/cloud-foundry-pivotal/news-2/cloud-foundry-foundation-bylaws-and-related-documents-now-available-to-the-public-on-cloudfoundry-org&gt; for 
public review. Hats off to the teams behind this important milestone.
 
 Read on to learn what’s new in field enablement, including mobile training that serves the field no matter where they are. Cornelia Davis profiles the coming CODE documentary, which puts a lens on the state of women in computer science. You may be surprised at what you learn. Progress is not linear, but the silver lining is Cornelia - and Pivotal’s - advocacy.
 
 Finally, the Pivotal Town Hall will have wrapped by the time this hits your inbox, and EMC CEO Joe Tucci and the EMC board will also visit us in Palo Alto next Thursday, 6 November.
 
 Enjoy!
BUSINESS UPDATE
 Messaging and Mobility – Enabling the Field in Q4
 Jennifer O’Neill &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/917586-jenniferoneill&gt;, Senior Manager, Field Enablement
It’s an exciting time for Field Enablement. As part of our effort to arm the Field to land new opportunities and drive momentum into 2015, we’ve launched Pivotal Ready &lt;https://pivotal.biglms.com/field_enablement/enablement_programs/pivotal_ready/q4_2014&gt;. This program focuses on developing specific demonstrable skills, including the ability to deliver impactful messaging for our major sales motions.
 
 A series of six whiteboard presentations introduce the Pivotal Big Data Suite &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/big-data/pivotal-big-data-suite&gt;, Pivotal CF &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/pivotal-cf&gt; and Mobile Solutions. Each scripted presentation will help facilitate two key conversations:


 - “Why Change?” (Factors putting your business at risk); and 
 - “Why Pivotal?” (How Pivotal helps customers drive new business and succeed).



Anyone keen to improve their Pivotal fluency can access these new whiteboards on the Pivotal Ready &lt;https://pivotal.biglms.com/field_enablement/enablement_programs/pivotal_ready/q4_2014&gt; page of Pivotal Academy’s Field Enablement &lt;https://pivotal.biglms.com/field_enablement&gt; site.
 
 In support of Pivotal Ready and other skills development efforts, training has also gone mobile with the launch of a new role-play tool – 
MX Skill Master &lt;http://www.mxskillmaster.com/&gt;. Sales and Field Engineering teams will be able to watch best-practice videos from any device; record and review their role-plays as often as needed; and submit them for video-recorded responses and reviews from their managers. This on-the-go training will increase messaging consistency across the Field – allowing more time for customers, while reducing travel and costs for traditional stand-and-delivers.

 Finally, I’d like to give a shout-out to our Product Marketers for 
developing the compelling whiteboard content. Many thanks to all of you rock stars! Feel free to connect with me &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/917586-jenniferoneill&gt; if you want to find out more on how we’re supporting the Field.
PRODUCT UPDATE
 Data Science Attracts Customers Seeking to Master the IoT
 Kaushik K. Das &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/949693-kaushikdas&gt;, Head of Data Science (Americas), Pivotal Data Labs (PDL)
The second half of 2014 has very been exciting for Data Science! By helping customers leverage the Data Lake and sensor data, we’re enabling them to take a coherent approach and create new business value around the Internet of Things &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things&gt; (IoT). This has opened up new vertical markets – such as in the oil and gas sector with Hess, Marathon Oil and Chevron.
 
 At Marathon, Rashmi Raghu &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/941695-rashmiraghu&gt;, 
Niels Kasch &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/960781-nielskasch&gt; and Rob 
Eckhardt are helping the customer mine massive drilling data with predictive analytics. Through advanced text analytics and machine-learning techniques, Pivotal is putting the customer on the path to saving millions of dollars by reducing unplanned downtime from drilling machine failures. Derek Lin &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/920037-dereklin&gt; and Regunathan Radhakrishnan &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/920485-regunathanradhakrishnan&gt; are helping Chevron secure their networks by using data to detect insider fraud activity.
 
 Some of the top purveyors of speed and performance in the automotive sector have also engaged Pivotal. We started with BMW last year and are now engaged with the Lotus Formula 1 team (led by Ellie Dobson &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1029935-elliedobson&gt;) and the Penske Indy team (led by Srivatsan Ramanujam &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/919405-srivatsanramanujam&gt;) to use data to respond more rapidly to changing situations in the racetrack. Tesla has taken note, and we’re engaged now with a crack Pivotal pre-sales team. Much of our success is predicated on our homegrown machine-learning library MADlib &lt;http://madlib.net/&gt;, and our ability to use R &lt;http://www.r-project.org/&gt; (environment for statistical graphics and computing) and Python &lt;https://www.python.org/&gt; within Pivotal Greenplum Database &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/big-data/pivotal-greenplum-database&gt; and HAWQ &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/big-data/pivotal-hd&gt;.
 
 The Finance space is also heating up. Pivotal Data Science Labs &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/agile/pivotal-data-labs&gt; has engaged with Credit Suisse, US Bank and Visa, and we’re well into engagements with JPMC and Fidelity. We did a very cool Data Jam &lt;https://drive.google.com/a/pivotal.io/file/d/0B_8A6f9ennXYa3JrNHdRVUF2VU0/edit&gt; for Biogen, where we worked with their computational biology department and made new discoveries with the Lupus 
data. There are too many projects to mention, and you can find the details here &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/departments/pivotal-data-labs&gt;. For useful customer stories from the data scientists themselves, check out our webinars &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/customer-marketing-and-programs/assets/data-science-story&gt;.
 
 Please let me know how 
we can help your customers on their IoT use cases!
AGILE UPDATE
 How Agile Brought Together Developer and Business Teams
 Martina Hodges-Schell &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/975143-martinaschell&gt;, Associate Director, Product Design, Pivotal Labs London
After Pivotal completed a successful Pivotal CF proof-of-concept for Fidelity, Pivotal Labs teamed up with Fidelity  &lt;https://www.fidelity.co.uk/investor/default.page&gt;Personal Investing &lt;https://www.fidelity.co.uk/investor/default.page&gt; in London to take things a step further, this time steeping Fidelity developers on the ins-and-outs of Agile development &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development&gt;, with the new enterprise platform serving as their workshop.
 
 However, shortly after the project started, it became clear to Pivotal and Fidelity that more value could be created by 
applying these new methods to building an internal application that would automate and improve the processes and collaboration between technical and business teams – enabling better decisions and ways to serve Fidelity customers.
 
 Pivotal Labs’ Kurtis Seebaldt &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1032463-kurtisseebaldt&gt; and Tom Anderson &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1060663-tomanderson&gt; led 
Fidelity through a revised project scope, which included creating a new app that advised fund managers about the cash positions in their portfolios. Product Manager Jesse Heitler &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1032773-jesseheitler&gt; trained the Fidelity project leader on Agile methods around task prioritization, team communication and serving as the product 
owner with confidence. As part of this, Pivotal introduced practices such as user research and experience design.
 
 Importantly, by creating a more direct and expedient feedback loop between Fidelity developers and their business teams, the developers could now connect the dots more clearly on what they did 
and how it impacted the business. Conversely, the business side could see more immediate results from their feedback.
 
 In just five weeks, by helping Fidelity shed lengthy processes in favor of an automated workflow through an app that enables them to better monitor their portfolio and take action where necessary. This in turn helps them to better serve customers. With the value of this education demonstrated clearly, we’re talking with Fidelity about potential future collaborations – and helping transform their business one use case at a time.
PEOPLE UPDATE
 Women in Tech: Two Steps Back for Each One Forward? 
 Cornelia Davis &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/914971-corneliadavis&gt;, Director, Platform Engineering, Cloud Foundry
When I was in college in 1985, majoring in Computer Science, little did I know that I’d be a part of a great statistic. At that time we would see the greatest percentage ever of Computer Science graduates in the US who were women – 37% percent of the total.
 
 Some 30 years later that percentage has dropped to an alarming 17%. That is just wrong in so many ways. I’m happy to say though, that Pivotal is committed to addressing the dearth of female developers through a number of initiatives – one of which is being an Associate Sponsor of the CODE documentary &lt;http://www.codedocumentary.com/&gt;.
 
 The film examines various factors that may account for the marked decline in women who enter and stick with Computer Science, and includes interviews with technologists, psychologists, neuroscientists and historians. The film is in production now (you’ll find Pivotal Labs throughout their trailer &lt;http://www.codedoc.co/about/&gt;) and, to support production costs, the filmmakers recently completed an Indiegogo campaign that raised 
more than $86,000.
 
 
 Changing the Cultural Landscape of Coding: Scenes from the CODE trailer
 
 The filmmakers are also signing 
on for a host of film festivals, with a premier planned for the first quarter of 2015. A recent article, The Fascinating Evolution of Brogramming and the Fight to Get Women Back &lt;http://www.fastcompany.com/3037269/strong-female-lead/the-fascinating-evolution-of-brogramming-and-the-fight-to-get-women-back&gt;, 
provides a great overview on the themes in the documentary.
 
 If you are interested in hearing more and finding out about events where Robyn Hauser Reynolds and Staci Hartman (the film’s co-producers) are featured, please let me know.
 
 Oh, and “bro pages &lt;http://bropages.org/&gt;”? Seriously?

 Jarrod Vawdrey &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1001643-jarrodvawdrey&gt;, Data Scientist, Pivotal Data Labs
am a Data Scientist on the Pivotal Data Labs &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/agile/pivotal-data-labs&gt; (PDL) team. My focus is retail. But for PDL I have also participated in engagements with some of Pivotal&apos;s media, insurance and finance customers.

Clustering 2 million outlets into like groups based on purchasing behaviors as a proof-of-concept for the world’s most recognizable beverage company. Outside of customer labs, I also support pre-sales efforts and experiment with various Pivotal technologies with the goal of better integrating Data Science models and insights into applications.
I enjoy spending time with my girlfriend, Lindsay, and my black lab, Bella (photo below).
for the first year working with Pivotal (Greenplum in those days), I lived on a broken-down, 1961 wooden yacht in the San Francisco Bay. While I did have the unpleasant experience a few times waking up in the morning with a boat half underwater, this was a small price to pay for the amazing views and experiences gained by living on the water.

is an exciting opportunity to work on interesting problems with amazing people using great technology.
