    <textOnly>Team,


As we learned in FY14 kickoff, our success this year will be impacted by our ability to effectively position Pivotal CF and Big Data Products.  Starting this quarter and going forward, we will be highlighting our best PHD/HawQ and best Pivotal CF stories through the creation of win stories and anonymous external-facing slides &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/customers/assets/external-slides&gt; for you all to use and learn from.


The anonymized slides are fully scripted in the presentation notes, and can be circulated in and out of your pitch decks.  The Win stories, which are internal only, contain a full transcript of rep interviews in the notes, with lessons learned, and details of what competitors did and said. 


Please share any feedback about these slides with Sophia Tseng &lt;mailto:stseng@gopivotal.com&gt;. 

Make it Happen!</textOnly>
