    <subject>Replay: Stuck in Traffic? Saved by Big Data!</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;http://www.pivotal.io/big-data/webinar/stuck-in-traffic-saved-by-big-data&gt;
Traffic volumes in cities around the world are constantly growing. To reduce traffic, we are faced with the challenge of how to control vehicle movements in a more intelligent way.   Watch this webinar &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/big-data/webinar/stuck-in-traffic-saved-by-big-data&gt; to learn how Pivotal&apos;s Data Science Team has developed several methods to analyze traffic information from real-time data sources. Using a variety of methods on a massively parallel analytics database system, the team will also demonstrate a traffic disruption model that can predict the duration of recent incidents – learning the disruption patterns of a major city.   

View the replay &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/big-data/webinar/stuck-in-traffic-saved-by-big-data&gt; for a unique opportunity to glean deeper insights into a problem and see what can be found by combining different machine 
learning methods. The world of Big Data is maturing at a dramatic pace and supporting many of the project activities, information users and financial sponsors that were once the domain of traditional structured data management projects.
