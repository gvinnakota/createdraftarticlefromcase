    <subject>Capgemini Partnership Announcement</subject>
    <textOnly>Team-

Today we announced a new strategic partnership with Capgemini &lt;http://www.capgemini.com/bdl.com&gt;, one of the world&apos;s foremost global System Integrators. In reading today&apos;s press release &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/press-center/12042013-capgemini&gt;, many of you will already be familiar with Capgemini, whose business extends across 44 different countries and 100 languages.
As part of this announcement, we are focused on co-innovation around the Business Data Lake &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/businessdatalake&gt;. The Business Data Lake is an entirely new way of thinking about how to store and manage data, based on the principle that access to information and collaboration is at the heart of delivering a competitive business. The joint Business Data Lake solution spans the Pivotal One technology stack and leverages Capgemini’s global presence and business-centric approach to information governance and reporting.
In support of the plans for the partnership, Capgemini and Pivotal are working together to establish a dedicated Pivotal Center of Excellence (CoE) within Capgemini’s Business Information Management (BIM) center in India, that will scale to 500 dedicated Pivotal product experts by 2015. This will allow the Pivotal Sales teams to leverage a partner with global presence and Pivotal expertise to deliver an end-to-end transformative solution to our customers, based on our Pivotal technologies.
Capgemini is actively engaging customers in discussions around the Business Data Lake and the positive reaction to the methodology is leading to further engagement with our joint teams. We are currently working closely with Capgemini in multiple accounts.  
To get involved, check out the press release and become familiar with the supporting assets &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/capgemini/&gt; and key contacts - and watch for an upcoming Spotlight webinar.
I’d like to congratulate the Global Alliance team and all who have brought Pivotal to the launching point for this partnership. There will be more to come with Capgemini as we continue to co-innovate customer focused solutions.
