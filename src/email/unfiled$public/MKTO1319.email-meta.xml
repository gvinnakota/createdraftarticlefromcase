    <subject>Organization Announcement</subject>
    <textOnly>I am sure you’ve all read Paul’s recent announcement about the changes to our organization. I’m excited to be leading the technology teams at Pivotal, and looking forward to working with you.

Effective immediately, Jamie Buckley, Konstantin Goldin, Gavin Sherry, Mark Dunlap, Randy MacBlane, and Suds Menon will report to me. Lan Haarmann is moving to report to Scott Aronson, and taking a new role as Scott’s Chief of Staff. Suhail Ansari will be moving to a new role as Special Advisor to the President, and will assist Scott Yara with thesis and strategy work.

After discussions with Hugh, I’ve decided to make several other changes, all effective immediately. These better align our products and teams:


 - Judes Sarmiento will report to Suds Menon, and Suds will be responsible for our core PHD area, as well as RTI and GemFire/GemXD work
 - Milind Bhandarkar will report to Suds Menon, and work closely with Suds on Hadoop technical strategy and execution
 - Eliran Malki will report to Mark Dunlap, aligning our work on MoreVRP closely with the GPDB team, and giving Mark responsibility for our Israel center
 - Ray Feng will report to Gavin Sherry, aligning closely our HAWQ efforts, and giving Gavin responsibility for our China centers
 - Roman Shaposhnik will report to Jamie Buckley, consolidating our Open Source efforts under Jamie’s leadership
 - Sameer Tiwari, Suhas Gogate, and Andrew Bennett will report to Suds Menon in his new role looking after our core Hadoop work
 - Maureen Delapena will provide executive assistance to Jamie Buckley


Please join me in supporting our leaders in their new responsibilities. I’m looking forward to spending time with the leaders in our data organization and working through detailed plans. Thank you for your support as we move through our organization transition.
