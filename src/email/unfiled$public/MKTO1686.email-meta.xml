    <subject>A little more on Pivotal CF</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name}},

Thank you again for visiting us at VMworld this year. I wanted to send you a little more information about Pivotal CF. 

Pivotal CF is the Enterprise version of Cloud Foundry and is a PaaS solution proven to be highly compatible with VMWare products &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/pivotal-vmware-cloud&gt; such as vSphere and vCloud Air. It is an open solution that can run on both public and/or private infrastructure technologies from other vendors, giving you high levels of flexibility. 

At our booth you saw our capabilities, namely:


 - Seamless DevOps integration
 - Automated environment provisioning 
 - Fast application load balancing
 - Failover and monitoring
 - Integration with common monitoring and log aggregation technologies such as Splunk, New Relic and App Dynamics


Please take advantage of our 60 day free trial &lt;http://run.pivotal.io/&gt; with Pivotal Web Services.

Please check out our Pivotal CF datasheet &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/sites/default/files/Pivotal%20CF_for%20Pivotal.pdf&gt; for a summary of Pivotal CF and its features. There are also a number of videos that talk through the features, including:


 - Pivotal CF 1.0 Demo &lt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfXamjLhJDI&gt;
 - Pivotal CF â€“ The Future is now &lt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7kYxpSMIME&gt;

Would you be available on Wednesday for a call?
