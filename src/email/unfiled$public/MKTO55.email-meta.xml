Dear {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

Enterprises are being driven to compete, innovate and execute faster than ever before, at a time when we’re witnessing the most disruptive platform shifts and advances in technology in over 30 years. 

Forward thinking organizations want to leverage new data sources by rapidly building modern applications, optimizing existing infrastructures and gaining insights in real-time. However, they are frustrated by high costs, un-scalable bloated architectures and non-agile practices. 
 
Join us at the first Asia Pacific Pivotal Summit 2013 &lt;http://www.pivotalsummit.shobiziems.com/register.php&gt; to learn how to overcome these challenges, so your organization can win with applications, data and analytics.
