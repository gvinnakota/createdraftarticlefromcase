    <textOnly>First Steps Towards Becoming a Data-Driven Insurance Enterprise



Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/ Madam}},
The insurance industry is experiencing significant pressure and change: insurers are adapting to slower demand in mature markets while reacting to growth challenges in emerging markets. Customers are increasingly more sophisticated in their knowledge of insurance products and are expecting simpler yet more personalized products. Social media and multi-channel interactions make it increasingly challenging to acquire and manage customers.
