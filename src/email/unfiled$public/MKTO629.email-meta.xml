Fireside on Sandhill
JOIN THE CONVERSATION WITH PIVOTAL AND GREYLOCK
Hello,
 
Please join us on Thursday, May 29th at 6 p.m. as we open our doors to friends and colleagues in Silicon Valley.
 
For the first installment of &apos;Fireside on Sandhill&apos;, we have invited Jerry Chen of Greylock Partners alongside Scott Yara from Pivotal and Alex Williams from The New Stack. This will be a conversation about open platforms in the enterprise, and also a look into what it means for startups. The software, platform and big data solutions necessary to gain advantage in the cloud-era are being deployed at an increasing rate, what do we have to look forward to?
 
Scott, Jerry, and Alex will discuss what they are seeing in this competitive space, what trends/patterns they care about, and what new technologies excite them most. We look forward to seeing you on May 29th.
 
Speakers:


 - Scott Yara, President and Head of Products (Pivotal), Founder (Greenplum) 
 - Jerry Chen, Partner (Greylock Partners)
