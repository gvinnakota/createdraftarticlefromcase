    <name>Corp Comm.PM - 2/10/15 Org Announcement</name>

    <subject>Company Update</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Colleagues,

As we enter 2015 and get ready for Sales Kick Off, I would like to take this opportunity to share some adjustments we are making in our core leadership team;



 - As you know we have asked Rob Mee to take responsibility for all products, R&amp;D and Pivotal Labs. Accordingly we are recognizing this with a promotion to Executive Vice President, Products and R&amp;D. The Cloud Foundry, Data, and Pivotal Labs teams, as well as IT, report now to Rob.
 - Bill Cook and Scott Yara continue as co-Presidents of Pivotal. Scott continues as a Pivotal Board Member.
 - The above move will allow Scott Yara to drive strategic imperatives and organizational alignment across the entire company with a maniacal focus on an “IPO-worthy” business model. 
 - Bill Cook will continue to be responsible for day-to-day activities of the company, with Field Operations, Finance, Legal and Corporate Development, Human Resources, and now Corporate Marketing reporting to him. 



Rob, Bill and Scott all continue to report to me. I will work with them, and the other members of our leadership team, to ensure that we not only meet our corporate business and product goals, but that we hold true to the principle that “how we do things is just as important as what we do,” and in so doing, “give more than we take.”

I look forward working with our leadership team and to engaging with all of you in 2015!

Thanks,</textOnly>
