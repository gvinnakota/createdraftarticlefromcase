    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},


We&apos;re happy to announce the availability of Pivotal GreenPlum Command Center (GPCC) 1.2.2.1. This release contains the fix for the bug (found in GPCC 1.2.2.0)  where users that are not &quot;gpadmin&quot; or &quot;gpmon&quot; cannot login to the GPCC UI/website.


You can download the binaries and release notes from https://network.gopivotal.com/products/pivotal-gpdb &lt;https://network.gopivotal.com/products/pivotal-gpdb&gt; under Greenplum Command Center. For customers having access to EMC software distribution website (SubscribeNet), the new GPCC 1.2.2.1 binaries can be found under the product section.


Thank you,
