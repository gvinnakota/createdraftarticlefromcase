    <subject>Join the DevOps Movement and Transform your Infrastructure</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

The DevOps movement has enabled organizations to leave behind months-long procurement cycles and instead get the infrastructure they need in a matter of hours or minutes. Greater gains can be realized when the application development and hosting platform provides capabilities further up the stack, at the PaaS layer.

Register &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/unlocking-the-value-of-devops-through-platform-as-a-service&gt; for this webinar and learn about the value of an application-centric approach to the complete platform, and how it can transform your infrastructure into an abstracted application layer that stands ready to initiate services on demand. Youâ€™ll also hear about outcomes experienced by Pivotal CF PaaS early adopters.
