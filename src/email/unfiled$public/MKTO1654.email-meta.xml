PIVOTAL BENEFITS NEWSLETTER 
OCTOBER 2014
As you may know, over the past year we have been focusing on creating and improving our new hire experience with our Welcome to Pivotal program.
Throughout this year the New Hire experience team has been collecting feedback from our new hires on how we are doing through monthly new hire retrospectives.
The feedback provided to us has been invaluable in helping us to further develop and iterate on how we can do better with welcoming new colleagues to Pivotal.

Based on feedback collected in 
several retros, we are pleased to announce a new enhancement to the Welcome to Pivotal experience: a global launch of the new Pivotal Buddy Program.

What is the Buddy Program?

The Pivotal 
Buddy Program was created to provide a single point of contact for our new hires to feel welcome and supported during their first day and beyond at Pivotal. Buddies will show our new hires the ropes, ensure they have the tools and contacts to be successful and help them with insights into the Pivotal culture.

How can you get involved?

To implement this program, we need your help!
We are looking for interested employees to volunteer to be buddies and invite you to be a part of this program.

If you are interested in signing up please complete this short form here: Buddy Self-Nomination Form &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/forms/d/1T9lSL2RhdyIaDDrHQPdTH4JaJdYCBiRd_ShvY13YYJY/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1&gt; by Monday, December 8th.

We&apos;ll review all the submissions and get back to you very soon with further information on how you can get involved.

More information on the buddy program can be found on  here &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/departments/human-resources/pivotal-buddy-program?pli=1&gt; on Inside Pivotal.

We hope youâ€™ll consider getting involved!
