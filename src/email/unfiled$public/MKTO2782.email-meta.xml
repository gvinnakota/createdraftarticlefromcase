    <textOnly>Team, 

We are in exciting times as we expand our global footprint and the level of activity around Pivotal Real Estate and Facilities is at an all-time high.

I am pleased to share that we have partnered successfully since Pivotal’s inception with EMC’s Global Real Estate and Facilities (GREF) in a model we refer to as Facilities as a Service (FaaS). A key component of this approach is to increase and decrease EMC’s involvement based on our requirements. Consequently, with the significant increase in our real estate expansion and needs globally, we have asked them to get more involved on a short term basis and, in particular, provide additional executive leadership overseeing our process.

To that end, Dan Fitzgerald, who started 
EMC’s facilities team 31 years ago, and Ted Lawson, a very experienced leader in the real estate field, will be working closely with us to provide this help. Ted will be onsite at Pivotal full time, and Dan will be splitting his time between West and East Coast. Effective immediately, Dan will be reporting to me as the interim Real Estate and Facilities Leader and Lisa and Ted will report to Dan.

Lisa will continue to be an integral part of our real estate leadership team and will manage much of the operations related to the facilities. Dan will lead our global expansion efforts and work closely with me and our business leaders to refine our location strategy. Ted, will take over much of this business engagement as he comes up to speed on Pivotal.

Given the complexity and depth of our real estate activities, we will also begin searching for a Global Head of Real Estate that will report to me.

Until we identify a new leader for 
the organization, please direct all inquiries, particularly for new sites or expansion projects to Dfitzgerald@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:Dfitzgerald@pivotal.io&gt;.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best,

-Leo</textOnly>
