Oct 29 | 2 Days of Spring with Josh Long: Building REST-ful services with Spring (Day 1)

Today&apos;s applications don&apos;t exist in isolation. REST applications and web services are a great way to connect applications together. REST is a design principle that imposes no constraints on the client except basic HTTP support, which all platforms provide. Designing REST services, however, is still as much art as it is science, as standards are emerging. Join Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long, and stealth presenters Craig Walls and Oliver Gierke, as they introduces some of the ins-and-outs of REST API design with Spring, building on Spring MVC, Spring HATEOAS and answers some commonly- asked questions like how to secure REST-ful services, 
and how to tailor payload serialization to your specific use cases.

Oct 30 | 2 Days of Spring with Josh Long: Have You Seen Spring Lately? (Day 2)

2013&apos;s been a busy year for Spring as part of Pivotal! Spring continues to meet the needs of next generation applications with support for 
stream processing, data integration, HTML5 and websockets, PaaS support and big-data workloads using Hadoop. Additionally, Spring - as part of a new company called Pivotal - is the heart of a rich platform along with Cloud Foundry, Grails, RabbitMQ, Hadoop, and Tomcat. Come see what&apos;s new and what&apos;s coming!

Nov 6 |  The Go Programming Language - A Recovering Java Dev Learns to Go with Matt Stine

The Cloud Foundry engineering teams have steadily increased their use of the Go programming language (http://golang.org) for building (or rebuilding) components, starting with the Router, and progressing through Loggregator, the &quot;cf&quot; CLI, and more recently the Health Manager 9000.As a recovering Java-developer-turned-DevOps-junkie focused on helping our customers and community succeed with Cloud Foundry, it&apos;s become clear to me that I need to add Go to my knowledge portfolio. Go is a very interesting language, open-sourced by Google in late-2009, that takes a &quot;less is more&quot; (http://commandcenter.blogspot.de/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html) approach to language design, but that also bakes in a powerful concurrency model.

This talk will introduce Go, delve into its distinctives, and contrast its approach with 
that of Java (where appropriate). We&apos;ll also write a fair amount of Go code along the way. This talk will be of particular interest to Java developers looking to add Go to their toolkits, but will also be of interest to anyone looking to learn a little bit more about Go.
