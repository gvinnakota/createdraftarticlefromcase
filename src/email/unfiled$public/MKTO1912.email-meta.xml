    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
 
Pivotal is coming off a great 2014 with our Agile development, Cloud Foundry, and Big Data Science offerings thriving. We&apos;ve built a great foundation for the pharma industry and our plans for 2015 are sure to raise some eyebrows.

 For a view into some of this excitement, please join me for great appetizers and drinks at Char in Raritan &lt;http://charsteakhouse.com/&gt; this Thursday, February 12. I&apos;ll be at the bar with one of Pivotal&apos;s best field engineers if you would like to talk technical.

Please shoot me a note if you plan on stopping by so I know how many stools to try and grab. Fun starts at 5:30.

Cheers,

Steve Schoenhaus
