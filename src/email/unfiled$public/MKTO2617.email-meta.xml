    <textOnly>Colleagues,

June marks LGBT Pride month, and in its stance against discrimination and the celebration of inclusion and community, it represents many of our very best Pivotal values.

Several Pivotal offices, from Chicago, Santa Monica, Toronto, San Francisco, New York, and Denver, among others, will hold events towards the end of June to celebrate the spirit of Pride as a Pivotal community. Happiness concierges will reach out with event dates and details for their respective offices.

We aim to do whatâ€™s right at Pivotal, and to strengthen our unique and diverse community. Pride celebrations are opportunities for teams to come together in support of equality, inclusion and community, so please join me and our leadership at any one of these events.
