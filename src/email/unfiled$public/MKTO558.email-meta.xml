    <textOnly>Thanks for joining the Pivotal Town Hall on Tuesday, and celebrating what has been an extraordinary first year for Pivotal. Every day we become more than the sum of our parts, with all the right ingredients – people, products, and passion – to lead an industry into the next-generation of cloud computing.
