    <subject>Data Science Summit 2013 is a Wrap!</subject>
    <textOnly>&quot;Data doesn&apos;t speak, people speak for it.&quot; -  @peteskomoroch at #DataBeat 

Many spoke for data at the DataBeat/Data Science Summit last week! The 
conference was filled with presentations from industry heavyweights and 
breakthrough working sessions. The world of data was well represented with topics ranging from healthcare, education, machine learning, visualizations, and much more.

Empowered by sharing ideas and methods in the community, data science has become a key differentiator. Organizations of all sizes and across all industries are using data science to solve problems, find new opportunities and achieve actionable results. 

Pivotal is an active and proud supporter of the data science community and will be hosting many more events dedicated to data science in the coming year. On January 28, Pivotal will be hosting a Data Science Meet-Up &lt;http://www.meetup.com/Pivotal-Open-Source-Hub/events/152875852/&gt;. Pivotal’s data science team leverages and contributes to this community of publicly-available and open-source technologies as part of their practice.
