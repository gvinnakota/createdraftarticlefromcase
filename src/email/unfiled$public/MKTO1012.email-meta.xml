Welcome to Pivotal! &lt;#new-pivots&gt;
EDITOR WELCOME
 Customers Tell it Best
 Steve Casale &lt;#author-socialcast-profile&gt;, Sr. Manager, Corporate Communications
At the global marketing gathering I was part of last week (we’re a small but mighty team) there was a good deal of electricity around the customer stories we heard: From Pivotal Labs helping businesses transition to whole new work styles, to the transformative effects of Pivotal CF (with 
an array of Pivotal CF mobile services &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/pivotal-further-defines-enterprise-paas-with-introduction-of-pivotal-cf-mobile-services&gt; announced this week). This issue offers a view into some of those customer stories, and how Pivotal is pulling them together for our teams.
 
 Don’t miss: VMware’s annual show-and-tell  &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/events/vmworld-2014-san-francisco&gt;happens next week, and Pivotal will be there to dazzle and demonstrate the power of our important Federation partnership with VMware. Finally, the folks who brought you open source PaaS through Cloud Foundry are on the road, bringing the Cloud Platform Roadshow &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/cloud-foundry-pivotal/news-2/pivotals-cloud-platform-roadshow-brings-pivotal-cf-to-cites-in-the-u-s-and-europe&gt; to an enterprise near you.
 
 Enjoy!
BUSINESS UPDATE
 Pivotal - The Force for Customer Transformation
 Sophia Tseng &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/967626-sophiatseng&gt;, Head of Customer Marketing
We’re fortunate at Pivotal to have a transformative impact on customers. In Customer Marketing &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/customer-marketing-and-programs/&gt;, our job is to find and bring to life the stories behind these customer transformations, and use them to turn potential customers into valued Pivotal clients.
 
 In the first half of 2014, we built the foundational customer references and systems you can leverage to show the Pivotal impact and difference. These assets include:



 - Big Wins and Business Cases &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/customer-marketing-and-programs/assets/external-slides&gt; 
 Each quarter we capture top Pivotal CF and the Big Data Suite deals to help you articulate the advantage of these key business cases, with confidence. Over 40 stories have been captured to date.  

 - Pivotal Reference System &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/customer-marketing-and-programs/references/reference-system&gt;
 We recently launched a streamlined reference system so the Field can easily find and share external customer materials with prospects and secure reference calls to help close deals. To encourage participation, we’ve linked prizes to the fulfillment of reference requests.



And we’re just beginning. Some current initiatives include:



 - First Pivotal Customer Webcast
 Aridhia &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/big-data/hadoop/customer-case-study/pivotal-hadoop-and-aridhia-revolutionize-healthcare&gt;, a top health informatics company, is using Pivotal HD and other Pivotal Big Data technology to drive sophisticated correlations between gene sequencing and clinical data – revolutionizing personalized medicine and how we approach chronic illnesses.

 - Pivotal’s First Customer Videos
 September is “customer month” at Pivotal, and our focus here includes customer testimonial videos on Qrious &lt;http://www.qrious.co.nz/&gt; (Telecom Digital Ventures), FjordIT &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal/case-studies-2/the-green-paas-innovative-data-centers-that-dont-use-10-of-the-worlds-electricity&gt; and more.

 - Data Science Customer Story Series
 Weekly webcasts illustrate customer challenges and how a powerful combination of Pivotal Data Science expertise and Pivotal technology helped solve them.

 - Customer Pitch Podcasts (Coming Soon!)
 In these internal podcasts, we’ll learn from some of our best storytellers – our sales reps – as they describe customer stories in their own words.



There are many chapters still to write, so stay tuned!
PRODUCT UPDATE
 Enter Pivotal GemFire 8.0: Enterprise-Grade Analytics Get Better
 Jags Ramnarayan &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/919767-jagsramnarayanan&gt;, Chief Architect, Fast Data Products
The Pivotal GemFire 8.0 release &lt;https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-gemfire&gt; is just around the corner! Real-time, in-memory processing has become an essential part of modern application development, and Pivotal GemFire &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/big-data/pivotal-gemfire&gt; 8.0 continues to help more than 800 customers serve up data at a massive scale. The latest release brings improved usability, high performance, and rock-solid stability to enterprise developers and operators. Many customers rely on Pivotal GemFire as the primary data store for some of the most demanding, high-volume, and latency-sensitive transactions spanning finance, transportation, retail and other verticals.
 
 Crunch Time
 With a focus on DevOps and operational 
productivity, we create value where it is needed most – enabling a faster, more flexible, more automated development experience. Just some of the value this release brings enterprises includes:


 - Increased developer productivity through an elastic, cluster-wide configuration service
 - Significant enhancements to our Spring Data &lt;http://projects.spring.io/spring-data/&gt; programming framework
 - Access from any REST client with out-of-the-box JSON support
 - Several enhancements that make managing large production clusters easier than ever (rolling upgrades to application logic, new versions of server software, quicker re-starts, etc.) 



Check out the release notes &lt;http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/latest/userguide/index.html#relnotes/release_notes_nc.html&gt; for the full catalogue of Pivotal GemFire 8.0 enhancements.
 
 Each Pivotal GemFire 
release undergoes tens of thousands of hours of automated testing (this version includes over 1,200 bug fixes). Through spirited collaboration, quality engineers and developers sort out distributed deadlocks, data inconsistencies and performance hotspots. Our summer interns also had a strong hand in this effort, creating Python and NodeJS clients using APIs that we plan to release as open source.
 
 With Pivotal GemFire 8.0, Pivotal brings its decade of data leadership to help rewrite the playbook on modern application development!
AGILE UPDATE
 Lean In: Lean Methods = Great Apps 
 Graham Siener &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/951892-grahamsiener&gt;, Product Lead for NYC, Pivotal Labs
Lean methodologies represent a big opportunity for Pivotal Labs to help change the way the world builds software. While we don’t guarantee that customers will win markets, we can apply lean methods to help them minimize risk and answer the question, &quot;Are we making the right product?&quot;
 
 We’ve been weaving lean approaches into recent projects with great success. One example is 120 Sports &lt;http://www.120sports.com/dashboard/#/catchup&gt;, a new sports media network that aims to be the &quot;TMZ of all sports&quot; – largely through mobile apps, powered by MLB Advanced Media. 120 Sports asked us to design a better workflow management tool for their TV production team in order to populate the snippets of information they stream (see “data cards&quot;, below).
 
 
 Pivotal makes it work right: 120 Sports’ “data cards”.
 
 Extensive research on user behavior and 
a problem backlog (queue of prioritized tasks to complete a job) informed our initial Minimum Viable Product. We also observed their production team’s work sessions remotely, recording the time it took to produce a segment and capture issues (time-aware user testing).
 
 In twelve weeks, we delivered a software product that enabled their teams to create eight hours of content for a sports 
show and respond quickly to breaking news. When we asked 120 Sports if they still wanted to use their Google Docs workflow, their response was a thunderous “No!”
 
 Testimony to success: The iOS app &lt;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/120-sports/id691285427&gt; has been at the top of the store rankings since its launch. We expect lean methods to anchor many similar successes. Watch this space for more!
PEOPLE UPDATE
 The New Face of Data Fabric Product Management 
 Jamie Buckley &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1056802-jamiebuckley&gt;, VP of Product Management, Data Fabric
Hi everyone! I joined Pivotal six weeks ago as VP of Product Management for Data Fabric and I’m very excited to be here. Like many others who recently started a new chapter here, I’ve been very busy and very impressed with the collection of talent here at Pivotal.
 
 Aside from ramping up and getting to know my amazing team, I recently represented Pivotal in a video &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csMdVgTPOIM&gt; with the CIO of GE Software on Industrial Data Lakes &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal/p-o-v/ge-shores-up-savings-for-aviation-with-a-data-lake&gt;, contributed a blog post on collaborating on Apache Ambari &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal/features/strengthening-hadoop-in-the-enterprise-with-apache-ambari&gt;, met with some of our 
data customers, and attended a blizzard of meetings.
 
 I’m now working with many people across the company to refine our 2015 data strategy. We have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us to define the playbook on how Big Data can transform the enterprise. In 2015, you can count on continued innovation – both on existing products and in new investment areas. We’ll also be looking to collaborate more with EMC, the App Fabric and Cloud Foundry teams, to name just a few.
 
 If you have thoughts about areas we should focus on for the future, please drop me a note. If you’re in the Bay Area, feel free to stop by my desk (at PA 2-232) to say hello.
 
 I look forward to working with you all!
MY NAME IS...
 Allan Baril
 Allan Baril &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/973451-allanbaril&gt;, Director, Internet of Things
Am a director focusing on the Internet of Things &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things&gt; and what services we can offer to customers related to this exciting area.
On the 10th floor of the Toronto office.
Determining what services, built on Pivotal CF and leveraging Pivotal’s product offerings, that we can offer customers to help quickly build a scalable system for ingesting, analyzing and providing actionable insight from the large amount of data produced by remote devices and sensors that a client may have.
I enjoy hacking with hardware – using cool devices like Raspberry Pi &lt;http://www.raspberrypi.org/&gt; and Spark Core &lt;http://docs.spark.io/hardware/&gt; to automate portions of my apartment.
In the past, as I was iterating on the user experience of a touch-enabled control panel for the space shuttle, I had the opportunity to meet and work with several astronauts at Johnson Space Center.
 
 
 Allan (far right) and family zip-lining at Grouse Mountain, Vancouver.
Is a great opportunity to work with incredibly smart people and a portfolio of amazing products. As collecting and analyzing large amounts of real-time data becomes more and more feasible, it’s truly exciting to see how Pivotal will help organizations optimize and transform the way they do business.
