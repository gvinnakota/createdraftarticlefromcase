    <subject>Pivotal Pulse Survey - Results and Actions</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Colleagues,

In our continuing efforts to learn how we can improve our workplace and employee experience, we conducted our first Pivotal Pulse survey in September, sending it to a sample that included approximately 25% of all employees.

We had a very solid response rate of 62% - so thanks to all who participated! Overall, 77% of the responses were favorable, and participants gave valuable feedback in areas to improve. The result highlights were as follows:

Areas of Strength


 - Company Mission - Participants expressed confidence in the future of the company.
 - Leadership - Participants believe that senior leadership makes sound decisions.
 - Employee Experience - Participants feel they have been given a real opportunity to improve their skills at Pivotal.



Areas for Improvement


 - Management Effectiveness - We need to address managerial basics. Feedback in this area was not great. Participants would like more feedback from immediate managers and for managers to be more engaging.
 - Teamwork - Participants indicated a greater need for teamwork across the company. Several of the comments referenced a desire for more collaboration between our technology groups (R&amp;D, Products, Labs).



Feel free to review the findings of the survey results here &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/presentation/d/16nuM_UsH6IHY70oYgj2anlC0eCCtW-RTL5pG2bkcja0/edit?usp=sharing&gt;.

Next Steps

We’ll use this data and other insights from your feedback (e.g., via focus groups) to launch and continue initiatives, which include: 


 - Manager awareness programs and trainings that help make Pivotal a special place to work.
 - With all engineering aligned under Rob Mee and IT’s commitment to supporting tools that accelerate collaboration, tools and initiatives in 2015 that facilitate greater collaboration across the company.



Looking ahead, we’ll conduct the next Pivotal Pulse survey in January with another 25% of our employees, and we’ll continue to update everyone on our progress. As we continue to move fast in making Pivotal a special place, your feedback is extremely important.

Thank you!
