    <textOnly>Team,

Earlier today, Paul again outlined our 2015 strategy and supporting decisions, of which one result will be rebalancing select functions and teams. Our job now is to rally behind that strategy as we show respect for the colleagues who have supported this mission, but will now continue their journey outside of Pivotal.

Much thought has gone into making us a successful, powerful, and independent company that will 
nurture the considerable strengths we carry into 2015. They include the huge potential to build and sell a platform like no other through Cloud Foundry and related services, bringing the successful “Labs-inspired” development culture across our engineering teams, and exceptional customer momentum in our data business.

Data is Pivotal
It is essential that you understand and are able to articulate the rationale behind our bold moves in data. Data is a hugely important facet of our strategy, and with at least a third of our sales forecast next year to come from data, it will be a huge factor in our growth.

The decision to align the Big Data Suite with open source is game-changing, and has many upsides. It will give us flexibility with enterprise customers who have seen the value of and believe in open systems and open source options. By aligning decisively to a well-established open source data market, we can unlock the value of and differentiate Pivotal data components - such as HAWQ, GPDB and GemFire - that have few, if any, open source peers. This will allow us to be more aggressive in pursuing customers.

All of this signals a clear opportunity for us to win.

You may have read our press release &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/big-data/pivotal-announces-all-star-leadership-team-for-data-business&gt; on our data leadership, and I couldn’t be more excited about this team of accomplished and focused leaders. To the extent that the broader market is unaware of the deeper strategic changes in our approach to data, competitors may use this leadership change as an opportunity to kick up fear, uncertainty, and doubt, and call our strategy into question. Our teams have put together a Data FAQ &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/document/d/15yYy_cFopubq6UpsgNP35B3PGUttal4ijJkZQgHl--Y/edit#heading=h.k2pu0r6pda39&gt; for you to reference. Please absorb this information and the guideline around its use, and read the data leadership press release so you can help customers understand the direction and value of our strategy.

You’ve been here before: adapting to and raising your game through business 
change. As always, you have my unwavering support and that of the entire company. I have every confidence that a short-term transition will evolve into a long-term strength, so stay focused on the bigger picture, and certainly on our Q4 and ‘14 close!

Make it Happen!</textOnly>
