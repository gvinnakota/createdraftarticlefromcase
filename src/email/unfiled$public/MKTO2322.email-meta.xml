A Message from Greg Stroud
APRIL 2015 SALES NEWS FLASH
Global Field Operations Team,

Please take the time to read this communication carefully; as there are Compensation, SFDC, Callidus and Product updates that you should be aware of.

Change on Accelerated Compensation
Pivotal is committed to becoming a world-class software company, with high earnings potential. We want to optimize every software-booking dollar and make sure that reps are highly compensated for making and exceeding their software product gates. The current plan has two triggers to hit acceleration (making your quota and making your GEO software product gate) with acceleration kicking in only after both triggers were met.

We are excited to introduce a change in our compensation plan that improves upside when 
at goal and creates even more opportunity to maximize annual payouts by selling software. What is changing and what you need to know:


 - After those two triggers are met we will retroactively accelerate all Software Product that was sold above the Software Product Gate.
 - The Software Product will be accelerated for both ACV and Backlog Years for orders that came in after the gate is achieved.



Please reach out to sales-commissions@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:sales-commissions@pivotal.io&gt;

Make More Money by Bundling Products with 
Services 
As a reminder, you can increase your Commissions payout by 10% by including services into your product deals! This includes Labs with PCF, PCF Services with PCF, and Data Science and or Pivotal Data Services with BDS! Subject to 
minimum deal size. Detail on the Bundles SPIF may be found here &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/presentation/d/1zOCuVNQX7vEa0F1zoTu1EA6V0GavDFHWDErktdkEEqU/edit#slide=id.g585bcb2bf_0117&gt;.

Compensation Tool (Callidus) Updates
GAFs rollout has been completed and by now, you should have all received a GAF and successfully accessed the tool. Now, you’re probably wondering when you’ll be able to review your Attainment and Payment Summary reports and we have good news! These reports will be visible in the tool by April 24th. Have a question on your commissions or reports? Within Callidus, click “Quick Tasks→Submit a Request” and a member of the compensation team will be in touch with you.

SFDC – What’s 
New
SFDC Opportunity Name Changes are here. Good news! The SFDC support team has recently implemented an enhancement that automatically adds the Account Name to the beginning of the Opportunity Name. This will greatly 
improve our search and report capabilities.

The goal is to provide enough information in the Opportunity Name field so that anyone reviewing the opportunity will know both the related account and high level details. By making sure the Account Name is included in the Opportunity Name, we can also leverage SFDC&apos;s search to show relevant opportunities when searching by Account Name.

Users should continue to add opportunity details in the Opportunity Name field (Labs - 
continue to include the project name and platform) and the application will add the Account Name. For example, if the user enters &quot;BDS&quot; once the opportunity is saved the Opportunity Name would be automatically updated to &quot;Account Name - BDS&quot;.

New Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operation Manager SKUs
As of April 13, 2015, Pivotal has released a brand new PCF Ops Manager set of SKUs through our EMC and direct channels. The SKUs have the same pricing as the old ones, however no longer include entitlement for non-production use of the following PCF services: MONGODB for PCF, NEO4J for PCF, RIAKCS for PCF, REDIS for PCF, MYSQL for PCF, PIVOTAL RABBITMQ for PCF, PIVOTAL HD for PCF

The new SKUs allow for a clear monetization strategy of production grade PCF Services and reduce some of the confusion customers have in understanding the distinctions between production and non-production scenarios. Some of these services will now be licensed through the Pivotal Services Suite for Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Big Data Suite SKUs while some of them will move to an open Beta stage. 

As a reminder, the Pivotal Service Suite for Pivotal Cloud Foundry, which was introduced in February, is priced per Service Instance and currently includes entitlement to REDIS for PCF, MYSQL for PCF, PIVOTAL RABBITMQ for PCF. The same changes will apply at VMware on May 1, 2015.
