Pivotal Celebrates One Year of Agile Development in Toronto &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal/news-2/pivotal-celebrates-one-year-of-agile-development-in-toronto&gt;
 
We recently celebrated the one-year anniversary of Pivotal’s presence in Toronto, having acquired local software development provider Xtreme Labs in October 2013. Pivotal’s investment in the Toronto-based office is part of a strategic plan to bring the best of mobile and web application development to global enterprises and start-ups alike.
 
Beginning with our official launch party, the Toronto office is a showcase for customers, developers, and partners to learn about best practices in software development and demonstrate how the world’s leading software applications are built, deployed and consumed.
 
The Toronto office will provide employees, partners, customers and others in the tech community with a focal point and place to visit to experience the latest in software innovation and development. We look forward to continuing our contribution to the burgeoning tech scene in Toronto.
