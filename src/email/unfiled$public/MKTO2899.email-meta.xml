    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Sorry we missed you at the Cloud Platform Roadshow in Atlanta on September 10, 2015. Our workshop gave attendees the opportunity to collaborate with their peers and get hands-on experience pushing an app on the CenturyLink cloud.

All of our sessions were designed to give you a deep dive into cloud native platform and how it can change the way you develop, deploy and scale applications for the cloud generation. 

Our presentation slides are available to you here:
