    <textOnly>Webinar: The Business Data Lake – an Evolution in Data Infrastructure
We&apos;re sorry we missed you.

Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

We noticed that you were unable to join us yesterday for the fifth installment in our &quot;What You Can Do With Hadoop&quot; webinar series. This session featured Steve Jones, Senior Director of Big Data and Analytics of Capgemeni, and covered the evolution of data infrastructure. Please feel free to watch the on-demand replay here &lt;http://bitcast-a.v1.o1.sjc1.bitgravity.com/greenplum/pivotalvideo/The_Business_Data_Lake_an_evolution_in_Data_Infrastructure.m4v&gt;.

At Pivotal, we continually work to offer educational opportunities that empower a global marketplace of organizations. If you have a minute or two, we would appreciate you taking this short survey &lt;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/HZST27S&gt; to let us know why you were unable to attend the session and how we might improve these webinars in the future. 

Stay tuned for registration information for our February installment.
