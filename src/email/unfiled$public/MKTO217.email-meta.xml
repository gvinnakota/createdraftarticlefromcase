Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Data scientists are like unicorns — they are hard to find and possess a divergence of skills including analytics, computer science, modeling, statistics and most important, the ability to be a good storyteller. Join your peers next week at DataBeat&apos;s Data Science Summit &lt;http://venturebeat.com/events/databeat2013/&gt; where the &quot;who&apos;s who&quot; of data science will be speaking. 


What&apos;s New

The two-day agenda is packed with new content including a segment called, &quot;Data Science in Action&quot; where we&apos;ll hear first-hand about the latest tools and innovations in data science. This year, we are hosting a &quot;Data Visualization Challenge&quot; around the theme of health. The visualizations will be on display and a panel of judges will be selecting winners for cash prizes during the summit. Submit your visualization here &lt;http://visualizing.org/contests/call-submissions-data-science-summit-2013&gt;.
