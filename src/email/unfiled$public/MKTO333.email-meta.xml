Collaborate and Prevail

 Hugh Williams had his R&amp;D All Hands yesterday afternoon – it was open and so was he. I appreciated his transparency and philosophies around execution and cross-team collaboration. He specifically mentioned working closely this year with Rob Mee and Edward Hieatt at Pivotal Labs.

 This edition of the biweekly Pivotal Newsletter is all about collaboration at Pivotal Labs. In the Business Update, we’ll learn about how Pivotal Labs will be the “tip of the spear” for Pivotal. Tracker’s Pivotal One plans are outlined in the Product Update. The People Updates highlight co-innovation with clients and partnering closely with R&amp;D, as well as Product Management and Design’s support of a number of Pivotal product teams.

 Speaking of collaborations, here’s a cool one that came up last week: Pivotal Labs used 
Spring technologies to work with the Obama Administration on the Green Button &lt;http://energy.gov/data/green-button&gt; project.

“In the long history of humankind (and animal kind, too) those who 
learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.”
 —Charles Darwin


BUSINESS UPDATE
Amar Varma
 VP, Pivotal Labs Sales


Tip of the Spear!

 Happy New Year! My name is Amar Varma. I was the CEO of Xtreme Labs and co-founded the business with Sundeep Madra to capitalize on the emerging mobile ecosystem. Since inception, we were inspired by Pivotal Labs’ approach to agile development and commitment to innovation. At Xtreme Labs, we sought to mimic and augment Pivotal’s best practices and thus, when the opportunity to join the Pivotal family surfaced, it was an easy decision to say YES!

 Now, as the VP of Pivotal Labs Sales, I’m looking forward to an exciting year ahead with 
challenges and growth for all involved. The key role for the Pivotal Labs organization will be to act as the &quot;tip of the spear!&quot; Strategic engagements with customers at Pivotal Labs will act as the initiating force and enable more Pivotal software business to follow.

 As part of my role, I will be formalizing the 
go-to-market team and transitioning the customer mix to focus on enterprises. With the combined expertise of Alex Luttschyn’s team and the Xtreme Labs’ business development team (under Rahul Singh), we are ready to hit the ground running and achieve our $100M+ goal for the year.

 We are here to augment and adopt both existing and new best practices, 
so please feel free to reach out at any time as we continue to empower our culture of innovation together. Great minds achieve great things, and I am certain that we will continue to lead the industry and recognize our 2014 goal!

Tracker is Launching Public Beta!

Pivotal Tracker &lt;http://www.pivotaltracker.com&gt; is the world’s most popular collaboration tool for agile software teams. Simple, yet opinionated, Tracker brings transparency to projects, encourages continuous feedback, and focuses teams on the most important priorities.

 As usage continues to grow, the Tracker team has been busy modernizing the product on several fronts. We’ve completely rewritten much of the codebase. Additionally, we launched a new, comprehensive API, along with an improved third-party apps directory to support our thriving developer community. We’re now about to launch a massively redesigned UI, with many new features, to public beta.

 One goal is to make Tracker more of a delight to use. But, more importantly, we want to make it scale with the needs of growing development organizations. Multi-project workspaces (which allow users to see and manage multiple projects side-by-side), cross-project search and improved notifications are just some of the features that will make Tracker easier to use on large projects. We’re also designing more powerful reporting, dashboard, and analytics tools to help with bigger-picture visibility. There is a long way to go, but the feedback so far has been very positive!

 We have also started to bring Tracker towards Pivotal One. Tracker will soon be available as an on-premises product for larger enterprise customers – deployed on, and integrated with, the Cloud Foundry platform. Later in 2014, Tracker will come to Pivotal Web Services, delivering a more unified experience for our Pivotal SaaS customers.

 Software is eating the world, and we’re excited to join forces with the larger Pivotal family at the forefront of a major transformation!

PEOPLE UPDATE
Edward Hieatt
 VP, Responsible for the Pivotal Labs business

Co-innovation and Partnership

 As Amar and Dan mentioned above, at Pivotal Labs we’re looking forward to an exciting year in which we firmly 
align the business with Pivotal’s overall direction. Pivotal Labs’ value proposition of co-innovating with clients to rapidly build great applications lends itself perfectly to Pivotal’s goal of turning customers into great software companies. The clients Pivotal is looking for can actually be great candidates for Pivotal Labs engagements, and vice-versa. So, we’ll look to engage clients that could benefit not just from Pivotal Labs services, but also from Pivotal One.

 For many Pivotal clients, the marketplace is undergoing real disruption. Pivotal Labs offers those clients help with their immediate needs to build great applications to stay competitive. But those clients are often also in need of platform and data solutions. In this way, Pivotal Labs can be the “tip of the spear” to help land the kinds of clients who are interested in making changes to their overall IT approach.

 We’ll also work in greater numbers with R&amp;D efforts on Pivotal One teams. Hugh Williams and I expect that Pivotal Labs’ participation on these projects (and practice using all the Pivotal One technologies) will not only help R&amp;D teams build great products, but also help Pivotal Labs identify opportunities for Pivotal One on client projects.

 I am 
already looking forward to the success that comes from this exciting partnership!

 VP of Product, Pivotal Labs

Product Management and Design Services are Booming at Pivotal Labs!

 We renewed our investment in Design and created our Product Management 
department less than two years ago, and we have hardly been able to keep up with the growth since. We now have over six product managers and product designers working on projects in offices around the world.

 Our team has been involved in a wide variety of projects – including mobile apps for retail and banking (in our Toronto office), web apps for healthcare (in New York and 
San Francisco), investment platforms for venture funding (in Santa Monica), a non-profit for conservation (in Colorado) and everything in between. We’ve also been supporting a number of Pivotal product teams, including Cloud Foundry.

 Our team has grown rapidly, and we are working hard to integrate with our new additions from Xtreme Labs. We are always on the lookout for more Product Managers and Product Designers, so please let your friends know that we are hiring!

HELLO, MY NAME IS…
Leanne Paura
 Associate Director, Product Design
 Pivotal Labs, Toronto

At Pivotal, I…
lead a team of 15 Product Designers in Toronto, with a focus on mobile.

You can find me…
juggling design allocations for over 25 
projects, in sales calls and scoping meetings, looking for new designers to add to our team, or checking out new/interesting apps, tools and design events.

Currently, I’m working on…
Carnival Cruise Lines’ mobile app and preparing for Fitbit 
Windows Phone 8 design (which should start in a week or so). 

In my spare time…
Spare time? What spare time? ;) I do love snowboarding, riding my bike around the city, going out dancing and travelling the world.

Something you probably don’t know about me…
(or maybe you 
do!) …I moonlight as a tech-house DJ called LeeLee Mishi. www.soundcloud.com/leeleemishi &lt;http://www.soundcloud.com/leeleemishi&gt; (&lt;-- shameless promo! ;) 

To me, Pivotal…
is big, powerful, driven…and different from Xtreme 
Labs in a lot of ways. I am learning more every day about what it means to be part of this new and exciting entity.
