    <subject>Thank You For Visiting Pivotal at JavaOne 2014</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
It was great to see members of so many different open source Java and communities coming together: Spring, Groovy, Grails, Cloud Foundry, Rabbit MQ, Redis, Apache Tomcat and Hadoop committers, together at one event. It’s clear that Java 8 adoption is surging forward in the industry as well as in Spring and Cloud Foundry. We hope you were able to experience demonstrations coming right out of the SpringOne2GX 2014 conference on technology like:

 - Pivotal Web Services &lt;http://run.pivotal.io/&gt; - a public Cloud Foundry service that offers the industry’s deepest and most comprehensive Java support: Java 8, Spring, Spring Boot, Groovy, Grails, RabbitMQ and a cross section of key Java EE services. 
 - Internet of Things, Hadoop, Hadoop Streaming/Batch processing with Spring XD 
 - Java EE on Cloud Foundry with JBoss and WebLogic Community Buildpack 
 - Microservice Architecture and PaaS with Spring Boot &amp; Spring Cloud
