    <subject>Town-Hall Follow-up with Rob Mee and Scott Yara</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi All,

Back in December the leadership sat down for a Town Hall to answer a number of questions. We couldn&apos;t cover everything that day, and we committed to getting back to you on unanswered questions.

I recently sat down with Rob Mee and Scott Yara to circle back on those questions, and we recorded that discussion &lt;http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1HNeeg5&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHbJSeDw775SHnVZp66pFFaz3VwYw&gt; to share with you. My conversation with Rob and Scott covers their insights on our strategic goals, developer culture, our data strategy, and other areas.

We&apos;re moving very fast, and you&apos;ll see more opportunities this year for you to connect with your leaders - through informal and live Q&amp;A sessions, 
more frequent Town Halls, and recorded discussions.

Enjoy this podcast &lt;http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1HNeeg5&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHbJSeDw775SHnVZp66pFFaz3VwYw&gt;, and let us know 
what you think.

Best,
