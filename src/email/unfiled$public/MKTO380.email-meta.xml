    <textOnly>Global Field Operations Team,
 
What a busy and exciting few weeks it has been in Field Operations! We had our first ever WWSKO, that introduced our new business strategy. We left with a clear focus to pursue Enterprise opportunities with the Big Data Suite and Pivotal Cloud Foundry, positioning us to become a world-class software company. Aligning with that messaging, we shared our new bookings policy, forecasting process, deal desk/review process, federation engagement, and FY14 compensation plan. The feedback has been great thus far, and we appreciate your participation and input. 
 
All of this content, along with the FAQs and the presentation recording is now available on our NEW Field Operations Inside Pivotal Page &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/departments/global_field-operations&gt;. 
 
The page has been designed to be your one-stop resource for all sales materials and documentation, making it easier to find what you are looking for more quickly than ever before. Please bookmark this site for your reference. We have also added a Socialcast feed to the bottom of the page to enable you to to stay up-to-date on the latest field initiatives. 
 
Good selling and let&apos;s close Q1 strong!
