    <subject>Pivotal Labs Media Weekly</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=}},
I hope everyone had a great weekend. It was a busy week last week with WWDC and thanks to all our partners who attended our Dinners and Events. Our team is gearing up to NYC next week with the Northside Festival and the Launch Beacons Conference taking place.  
In Pivotal Labs fashion, we have sponsored a Pool Party on June 12th for the Northside Festival that will have a great crowd for you to network with. We are also osting the Launch Beacon and Location conference on June 9th. Please do get in touch with me to attend any of these events.
Below is our weekly email series, highlighting top stories impacting media companies in the mobile space. This was a very big week in news and we have curated some of the most important stories for you. We hope you continue to find this content useful and informative.
1. Twitter Buys Mobile Native Ad Startup Namo Media For Around $50M &lt;http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/05/twitter-buys-namo-media-to-expand-its-native-ads-offering/&gt;
Twitter has purchased native advertising firm Namo Media to beef up the company’s native advertising business. Terms of the deal were not announced, and Namo Media’s Technology will be directly integrated into Twitter’s MoPub platform. The social network bought MoPub in September and rolled out an ad-buying platform in December that lets marketers buy native ads in apps like Tango that appear in news feeds and messages.
2. Verizon sends Netflix cease and desist over streaming quality warnings &lt;http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/5/5783338/verizon-sends-netflix-cease-and-desist-over-congestion-warnings&gt;
This one could get messy. Yesterday afternoon, Qz reported on a message that some Netflix/Verizon customers were seeing which pinned potential video quality issues on Verizon’s network being “crowded.” Verizon, as you might expect, was none too happy to hear about this, and now they’re threatening legal action. The core of Verizon’s complaint: There are tons of points of failure along the road that could cause network slowdown, and if Netflix is going to point the finger at Verizon, it’s up to Netflix to prove it.
3. Dropbox acquires Droptalk, another stealth messaging startup &lt;http://www.citeworld.com/article/2360228/cloud-computing/dropbox-acquires-droptalk-another-stealth-messaging-startup.html&gt;
Dropbox has swallowed up another early stage startup, this one a stealthy company called Droptalk which was developing a tool that allowed you to share links privately with friends via a Chrome extension, to be followed by both iOS and Android applications. None of the products were publicly available, as the company had only just launched its browser add-on into a limited beta.
4. Google Public Alerts will begin pulling in tweets to help save us from disasters &lt;http://bgr.com/2014/06/05/google-public-alerts-twitter/&gt;
Google has announced that starting Tuesday, its Public Alerts service has begun incorporating tweets from disaster-struck locations. Now, when the company issues a public disaster alert from official sources, such as the National Weather Service, it will include relevant tweets in Google Now, Search and Maps, as well as on its Public Alerts website. The announcement came via a Google+ post from the Google Crisis Response team. Google made the Crisis Response page to make critical information more accessible in times of disaster.
5. Apple flexes healthcare muscles with new wearable device &lt;http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Apple-flexes-healthcare-muscles-with-new-wearable-device&gt;
Apple may release its first smartwatch in September alongside the iPhone 6, according to Cantor Fitzgerald&apos;s Brian White. White says it will cost around $200 and be a companion device to the iPhone. He&apos;s also predicting that we will see a big-screen, 5.5-inch iPhone 6 &quot;phablet.&quot;
Apple is expected to begin making iWatch components this month and will accelerate production in the fall, White said in a recent note.
6. Aereo adds Chromecast support to its Android app &lt;http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/5/5783238/aereo-adds-chromecast-to-android-app&gt;
Aereo, the cloud-based live TV streaming service, finally rolled out an update to its Android mobile app to fulfill the desire of Chromecast users who have been eagerly awaiting the update since it was announced in April. Aereo for Android, which received the update Thursday, now features support for Google&apos;s tiny $35 HDMI dongle Chromecast. This means users can stream live television broadcasts through Chromecast on TV without paying for cable or a satellite provider.
7. Google in talks to buy music streaming service Songza &lt;http://nypost.com/2014/06/06/google-in-talks-to-buy-music-streaming-company-songza/&gt;
Larry Page is moving fast to build his search giant’s street cred in the rapidly growing music streaming business.  Songza has been around for 6 years and based out of Long Island with 5.5 million users.  The shocking part here is that the offer from Google appears to be $15M, when compared to other music streaming apps this seems very low.
Have a great week!
