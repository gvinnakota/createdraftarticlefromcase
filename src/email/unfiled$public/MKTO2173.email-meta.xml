    <subject>Pivotal Big Data Roadshow – this Thursday 3/26 is in Palo Alto!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello Palo Alto colleagues,

The Pivotal Big Data Roadshow &lt;https://pivotal.io/big-data/data-roadshow/paloalto&gt; will make its way to the Palo Alto office this Thursday, March 26th.

With an expected 100 customers, prospects and partners in attendance, we plan to have a great day for all involved. Attendees will have the opportunity to learn about the very latest in Big and Agile Data, and the best practices helping organizations today leverage data for Internet of Things (IoT) applications and build-outs.

Please help accommodate our guests that day by observing the following practices: 


 - The roadshow will make use of the entire cafeteria/event area from 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM.
 - Pivotal breakfast will still be provided for employees, but please eat early, or take your breakfast back to your desk after 9:00 AM – the roadshow starts promptly at 9:00 AM.
 - While you can still order lunch, space in the cafeteria will also be limited, so please plan on eating outside, in the Tesla conference room, or in the upstairs touchdown stations.
 - Employees interested in watching the live presentations may use the standing-room space at the rear of the cafeteria. We have limited seating available, and we want to ensure that all registered attendees are able to fully participate.



Thank you for your understanding and cooperation!

Cheers,

Paul Santos
