<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Below is our weekly email series, highlighting top stories impacting media companies in the mobile space.
  This was a very big week in news and we have curated some of the most important stories for you.
  We hope you continue to find this content useful and informative.</span></p>

 </strong><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/21/5737724/spotify-hits-10-million-paying-subscribers?utm_content=bufferc20fe&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer"><strong>Spotify's Paid Subscriber Count Soars to 10 million</strong><br /></a>Spotify has  
reached the 10 million subscriber mark, an important milestone as it competes in the increasingly crowded streaming music market.
  The new number, which Spotify announced in a blog post, is up from 6 million subscribers in March 2013.
  In addition to the paid subscriptions, Spotify also announced 40 million active users, an important base for a company that relies on using free music to eventually convert listeners into subscribers.
  That number is up from 24 million, which was also announced in March 2013.
  "We've had an amazing year, growing from 20 markets to 56 as people from around the world embrace streaming music.</span></p>

 </strong><a href="http://recode.net/2014/05/21/facebook-shazams-itself/"><strong>Facebook Shazams Itself</strong><br /></a>Facebook will add technology to its mobile apps that recognizes the music, movies or television shows its users are enjoying, in the company's latest move to give prominence  
to media and entertainment on its social network.
  The new feature, which must be activated by the user and is off by default, would create a status update on Facebook that identifies the song a user is listening to and provide a 30-second preview of it that's available to the user's friends.
  Facebook, which announced the move in a post on its official blog on Wednesday, is working with streaming music services Spotify, Rdio and Deezer to offer the music previews.</span></p>

 </strong><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/05/21/secret-anonymous-android/?ncid=rss_truncated"><strong>Psst, Secret's Anonymous Sharing App Finally Arrives on Android</strong><br /></a>Mobile gossip is going global.
  Secret, the anonymous social network, announced on Wednesday that it will be available for download in every country in the world.
  The company also launched an Android app on Wednesday morning, making the service available on both major smartphone platforms for the first time.
  The app is simple: You&rsquo;re presented with a blank text box in which you can share photos and text anonymously.
  That usually lends itself to lascivious, gossipy or downright catty threads that quickly circulate in certain Twitter and Facebook circles.
  (Good for growth, I imagine, but bad for image.)</span></p>

 </strong><a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/05/19/samsung-sold-an-estimated-500000-smartwatches-in-q1/"><strong>Samsung Sold an Estimated 500,000 Smartwatches in Q1</strong><br /></a>According to a report from Strategy Analytics and Yonhap News, Samsung&rsquo;s sales of smartwatches trump all  
competitors, holding at 71% of the marketshare.
  Thanks to selling a reported 500,000 smartwatches in Q1, Samsung easily maintains seniority over other competitors such as Sony, Qualcomm, and Pebble.
  Compared to last year, Samsung sold roughly 1 million smartwatches over the course of four quarters, but thanks to a monstrous marketing push for the Galaxy Gear (you undoubtedly saw it on the wrist of many NBA stars and commentators), Samsung saw a major boost in sales.</span></p>

 </strong><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/20/shutterstock-music/"><strong>Shutterstock Introduces Music Licensing Service, Starting With 60K Tracks From Rumblefish</strong><br /></a>Shutterstock is mainly known as one of the largest sources of licensed images and videos, so it&rsquo;s not  
entirely surprising that the company is going into licensed music as well.
  The company has just launched Shutterstock Music, which is a marketplace for, what else, music of every genre and style.
  The site makes it easy for online video producers, creative directors, broadcasters and anyone else to easily license music for their projects, and aims to help musicians tap into an extra source of revenue.</span></p>
