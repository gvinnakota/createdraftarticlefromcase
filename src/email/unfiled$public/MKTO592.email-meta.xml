    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Thank you for joining us last week for our webinar &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/big-data/webinar/stuck-in-traffic-saved-by-big-data&gt; 
&quot;Stuck in Traffic? Saved by Big Data!&quot;. We hope you found the session informative. 

We reviewed how Pivotal&apos;s Data Science Team has developed several methods to analyze traffic information from real-time data sources. Using a variety of methods on a massively parallel analytics database system, the team demonstrated a traffic disruption model that can predict the duration of recent incidents â€“ learning the disruption patterns of a major city.

We look forward to you joining us next time. 
 
Thank you,
