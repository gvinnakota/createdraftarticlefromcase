    <subject>Design at Pivotal, an expanded role for Tim McCoy</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Colleagues,

Last fall, we saw the need to further align our Big Data Suite and Cloud Foundry teams and brought them under unified leadership. Each day we are working to ensure our three capabilities of Cloud Foundry, Big Data, and Labs reinforce each other as we evolve into “one Pivotal” with a shared culture and approach.

To further these goals, I have asked Tim McCoy to take on the new role of guiding product design for all Pivotal products and services. Tim has established the product design practice for Labs over the past few years, developing new capabilities in research, lean user experience, visual design, and user-centered product strategy.

Tim will also be working with Richard Snee and the marketing team to 
continue to align our public messaging and brand identity, and help ensure our culture and philosophy show through in the way we present ourselves to the world.

Over the next few weeks, Tim will be spending time in various parts of the organization to understand the 
current state of the product design process and looking for opportunities to help as his role expands beyond Labs. Please join me in welcoming this broader voice of design at Pivotal.

Regards,
Rob</textOnly>
