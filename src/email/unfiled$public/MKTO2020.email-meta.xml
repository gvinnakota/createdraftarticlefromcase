    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Pivotal Customer}},

Pivotal recently made three key announcements about our data strategy and product roadmap that address the fragmentation and complexity that have grown in the big data space and have hampered innovation cycles for many enterprises.

We think it’s important that our customers have an opportunity to participate in transforming their IT future. These announcements detail how Pivotal is committed to providing you a comprehensive big data platform through a strengthened and unified Hadoop core - offering you more choice, flexibility and agility.

A New Open Data Platform to Drive the Enterprise Adoption of Apache Hadoop® and Big Data &lt;http://pivotal.io/big-data/press-release/technology-leaders-unite-around-open-data-platform-to-increase-enterprise-adoption-of-hadoop-and-big-data&gt;
Pivotal is a founding member of the Open Data Platform (ODP), an industry effort to develop and advance a common data core around Apache Hadoop® &lt;http://hadoop.apache.org&gt; and big data technologies.

The ODP includes 15 founding member companies: GE, Hortonworks, IBM, Pivotal, SAS, Infosys, EMC, VMware, CapGemini, Altiscale, CenturyLink, Splunk, Teradata, Verizon, and an international telecom. More at www.opendataplatform.org &lt;http://www.opendataplatform.org&gt;.
