    <textOnly>Team -
We arrived to clouds in Monterey - and for many, an understanding of our Pivotal marching orders was just as cloudy. 

Yesterday we left not only with crystal clear skies, but also clarity of thought and purpose: 



 - We know the company target is $322.5M and I have asked that within that goal, we set a stretch target of $185M of software, subscription and support. 




 - We know the Pivotal One story, and will tell it through sales plays focused on our Big Data Suite, on PaaS/Pivotal CF and the advantage of our strategic services.



In the coming weeks, you&apos;ll learn how to access content from our days at Kickoff as well as links to videos of Mainstage sessions for a refresh or a motivational push.




I&apos;m asking each of you to act on the investment we&apos;ve all made in being together this week, because if we do, the return is going to be immeasurable. 
As one company of supportive colleagues, remember to learn from one another. We heard the message from some inspiring sources that &quot;power comes in what we are going to do together&quot;. I expect you to hold each other accountable, and also to hold yourselves accountable.




Determine how you will contribute to the company&apos;s mission and objectives for 2014 - and what steps you will take to make &quot;a realm of possibility&quot; a reality. 
Then Make it Happen.

This week has been incredible. I had a great time with our Pivotal family and I hope you did too. We hit a meaningful milestone - and I&apos;m excited about all that lies in front of us.
