    <subject>Making Your Mac a Safer Place to Work</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi All,

We want everyone to feel confident that 
everything we develop together stays in good hands.  Many of you already have your Mac set up with good basic security settings. Soon we’ll push these settings out to everyone to make it easy and consistent.

We&apos;re updating the default settings for all Pivotal Macs starting on October 28, 
2014.  You&apos;ll be asked to restart your computer, but if you are in the middle of something, you&apos;ll be able to defer the restart until you&apos;re ready.

Most of our computers have these settings turned on already, but if yours doesn&apos;t, we want to let you know what to expect:



 - Strong Password: But not impossible to remember.  Minimum 8 characters, at least one uppercase character, at least one letter, at least one number, and at least one symbol.

 - FileVault encryption: Encryption protects all the data stored on your computer if it’s stolen or lost, making it impossible to read without your 
strong login password.

 - Screen Saver after 10 minutes: So you can walk away from your computer without worrying about your co-workers changing your desktop 
background.
 - Sophos Cloud: Lightweight virus checking software that stays out of your way.


If you run into any issues or have any questions, please don&apos;t hesitate to email ask@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:ask@pivotal.io&gt; so we can give you a hand.

Best,
