Traffic volumes in cities around the world are constantly growing. To reduce traffic, we are faced with the challenge of how to control vehicle movements in a more intelligent way.

Please join us &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/big-data/webinar/stuck-in-traffic-saved-by-big-data&gt; for this live 
webinar to learn how Pivotal&apos;s Data Science Team has developed several methods to analyze traffic information from real-time data sources. Using a variety of methods on a massively parallel analytics database system, the team will also demonstrate a traffic disruption model that can predict the duration of recent incidents â€“ learning the disruption patterns of a major city.

Register today &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/big-data/webinar/stuck-in-traffic-saved-by-big-data&gt; for a unique opportunity to glean deeper insights into a problem and see what can be found by combining different machine learning methods.
