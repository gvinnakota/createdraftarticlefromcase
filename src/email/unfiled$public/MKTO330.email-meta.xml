    <subject>ACTION REQUIRED: Join Socialcast for WWSKO</subject>
    <textOnly>Team,
 
Can&apos;t wait to see you all next week!
 
There will be NO printed materials at the event. That means the agenda, questions, event announcements and files will all be shared within Socialcast. As a result, joining Socialcast and downloading the Socialcast Mobile App are required in order for you to view the agenda, fully participate, and engage at our Worldwide Sales Kick-off 2014. 
 
Socialcast will be the main source for all the WWSKO info you need. Please ensure you get this done by week&apos;s endâ€¦.

 

WHAT&apos;S NEXT?
