Come and learn how to use Caching to boost up performance of Spring applications: when should you use caching? Are there any tradeoffs? Which are the options?

We will be covering 3 exciting topics:

 - Caching abstraction in the Spring framework. Michael Isvy (Pivotal) will showcase the new @Cacheable annotation in Spring;
 - Caching using Redis and Redis integration inside Spring Data. Sergiu Bodiu (Merrill Lynch) has been using the open source caching framework Redis for over a year. He will teach you some tips and tricks on how to work with Redis; 
 - Caching with SqlFire. Wang Yi is a presales engineer at Pivotal. SqlFire is a distributed cache that you can interact with using &quot;plain old Sql&quot; syntax.

Register now! We look forward to your participation.
