    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

 Thank you for attending the Pivotal Cloud Platform Roadshow in Minneapolis, October 2, 2014. We hope our workshop gave you the opportunity to collaborate with your peers and get hands-on experience pushing an app on Pivotal Cloud Foundry. 

 Your feedback is important! Please take our short survey &lt;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/SN32K28&gt; so that we can continue to make future workshops informative and relevant.
