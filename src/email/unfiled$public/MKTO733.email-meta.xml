1. Microsoft Buys Mobile App Management Platform Capptain To Beef Up Azure &lt;http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/28/microsoft-buys-capptain-a-mobile-app-management-platform-based-in-paris/?utm_content=buffer81bfa&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer&gt;
Microsoft Corporation has announced that it has acquired Paris-based startup Capptain, a company that provides app developers with analytics. It can also send push notifications based on customer usage patterns. Capptain will be integrated into the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. The terms of the deal were undisclosed. Capptain raised around $2 million in funding and $1.5 million of that was from Runa Capital. This is Microsoft’s fifth acquisition out of France. Prior to the acquisition Capptain supported platforms like iOS, Android, HTML5, Web OS, Blackberry/RIM, Windows Phone, and the Samsung Smart TV.
2. Apple Buys Beats for $3 Billion &lt;http://online.wsj.com/articles/apple-to-buy-beats-1401308971&gt;
Apple has indeed purchased Beats, which includes both Beats Audio hardware and Beats Music, the streaming radio service that was founded by rapper Dr. Dre and longtime music industry exec Jimmy Iovine. The deal was reported to be in the works earlier this month, and was said to be worth an estimated $3.2 billion at the time, though a recent New York Post report said it was cut to $3 billion after Apple completed its due diligence. The price is indeed $3 billion, with $2.6 billion in cash and $400 million in stock.
3. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer Said To Buy LA Clippers For $2B &lt;http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/29/former-microsoft-ceo-steve-ballmer-said-to-buy-la-clippers-for-2b/&gt;
Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has agreed to buy the Los Angeles Clippers for a record-breaking $2 billion US. Now it&apos;s up to others whether the deal goes through. Shelly Sterling said in a statement issued late Thursday that she&apos;d signed a binding contract for a sale of the Clippers by The Sterling Family Trust to Ballmer in what would be a record deal if approved by the NBA. Ballmer &quot;will be a terrific owner,&quot; Sterling said, &quot;We have worked for 33 years to build the Clippers into a premier NBA franchise. I am confident that Steve will take the team to new levels of success.&quot;
4. Amazon Prime to launch music-streaming service, report says &lt;http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-amazon-music-streaming-service-20140529-story.html&gt;
Amazon is about to round out its Prime subscription service with a music streaming service, BuzzFeed reports. The service will stream old and new-ish music to Prime subs and will launch in June or July. The music service will likely be bundled with Amazon’s Prime service that currently offers subscribers with free two-day shipping and access to a video streaming service and ebook lending library. However, the music service will leave Rdio and Spotify users wanting more. New releases will not be offered.BuzzFeed reports that the music catalog will offer a limited selection of songs and albums that are six months old or more. But that’s how Amazon rolls.
5. Twitter’s ‘Zero’ Service Lets Emerging Markets Tweet For Free &lt;http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/29/twitters-emerging-market-strategy-includes-its-own-version-of-a-facebook-zero-like-service-called-twitter-access/&gt;
Twitter Inc has launched a new service called “Twitter Zero.” This service lets users in emerging markets see a stripped down version of Twitter and use the service without incurring data charges. Twitter has slightly under 100 total deals with mobile operators, according to TechCrunch. Some of the mobile carriers that are working with Twitter on this project include Ucell (Uzbek), Mobilink (Pakistan), Reliance Communications (India), and Ncell (Nepal). Other partners include Vodafone, Smart (Philippines), XL Axiata (Indonesia), and Turkcell.

 Have a great week!
