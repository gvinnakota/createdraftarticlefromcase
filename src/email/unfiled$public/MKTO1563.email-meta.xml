Why the Xbox One will Take Over the Living Room &lt;http://pivotallabs.com/why-the-xbox-one-will-take-over-the-living-room/&gt;
 
November 22 marked the public debut of Microsoftâ€™s new console, the Xbox One. It&apos;s much more than just another gaming system: similar to how all sound signals must travel through a receiver before being broadcast through a sound system, Xbox One is becoming the layer that video travels through before being broadcast on the television screen. And why would you want to watch TV through another device?
 
The Xbox One enhances the experience; with Modern UI&apos;s snap feature (which runs apps simultaneously with the main screen in a dialog box on the side), Xbox One users can watch TV or run other apps while playing a game and remain connected. Its HDMI input allows users to watch TV through it (or play the PS4 apparently). What exactly does this mean, and why do we believe that the Xbox One is one of the most potent devices in media today?
