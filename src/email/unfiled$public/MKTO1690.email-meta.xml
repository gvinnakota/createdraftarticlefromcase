    <subject>Pivotal Town Hall - Thank You, Town Hall Survey</subject>
    <textOnly>All,
Thank you for taking the time to attend the 30 October Town Hall. More than 1,100 people attended the event live, or viewed it in groups or online.

If you did not get a chance to attend or watch the webcast, do make time to watch the Town Hall replay &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/employee-information/pivotal-town-hall&gt; (requires Okta authentication). Please also take a few minutes to fill out a brief Town Hall survey &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/forms/d/1t8xv911aWYFbHSJ3DNN73UnGtdEjukJLMoHntN6nn88/viewform&gt;. Your feedback helps us better plan topics to cover in future sessions.

I hope you found the event informative. The executive leadership aims to be clear and transparent on our 2015 strategy to accelerate and meet our goals in a fast-changing market. As we adapt and grow, all of us are committed to making thoughtful transitions, and to building a strong culture and special workplace.

We have many more believers than we did a year ago, and we have every confidence in the ability of our talent to execute on our strategy. The key now is to sharpen our focus and discipline to turn that momentum into more new customers. If we do this, we will achieve everything we set out to do.

Finally, please remember that EMC CEO, Joe Tucci and the EMC Board will be in the Bay Area for a regular Board meeting, and weâ€™re delighted to host them for another Town Hall-like gathering next Thursday, 6 November, in Palo Alto, at 9:00 A.M. Look out for an invitation to that shortly, and please make every effort to attend it live if you are in the Bay Area.

Thank you for being part of the Pivotal team. Please reach out to any of us on the executive staff or to your managers with comments or questions.

Best,</textOnly>
