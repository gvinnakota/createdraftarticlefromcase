    <subject>An Important Announcement From Scott Aronson</subject>
    <textOnly>Team - 

Since the initial go to market message was sent out late in September (found in the Solutions section on Socialcast &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/groups/87621-pivotalsolutions&gt;), the Field has generated significant RSA/Pivotal momentum that will lead to great things in Q4 and beyond. 

Just about a dozen joint RSA/Pivotal opportunities are in flight across the organization, including a tremendous security-based offering with RSA and Capgemini that can represent our initial GTM use case for the Business Data Lake. 

That said, I understand there are instances of miscommunication in the field that are disturbing this momentum and confusing the customer. To maintain and accelerate the initial momentum, it is critical everyone understand that our position in the area of security is much stronger working collaboratively with RSA than working alone. We should be talking about how our capabilities enhance or expand the value of RSA&apos;s Security Analytics platform. We should not talk disparagingly about the product capabilities in any way. We need to be arm-in-arm with RSA in order to maximize the security solution opportunity. 

Here is my ask of each of you: 

1. Get to know your RSA counterparts and understand the Security Analytics platform.
 2. Share joint customer and prospect lists and look for overlap. 
3. Develop a coordinated account plan that focuses on customers that look to expand security analytics into a larger data lake or analytic framework. 

We have examples of this occurring in the NY/NJ region and we would like to see this dialog occur across all regions and theaters. 
A FAQ document &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/file/d/0B11AgRZK5LGDZVlNaE84WXpKVEU/edit?usp=drive_web&gt; and positioning deck &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/file/d/0B11AgRZK5LGDN3NlSm9wUnB1MWc/edit?usp=drive_web&gt; provide additional information and details about the GTM message, the products and capabilities.
