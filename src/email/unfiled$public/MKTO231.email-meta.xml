Sorry We Missed You.
Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madame}},

It&apos;s been an exciting few months at Pivotal since the inaugural Asia Pacific Summit in Singapore! On November 12, we introduced the world’s first next-generation multi-cloud enterprise PaaS — Pivotal One™ &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/paas&gt;. Pivotal One, is a comprehensive, multi-cloud enterprise PaaS comprised of a set of application and data services that run on top of Pivotal CF™, the leading enterprise distribution of the Cloud Foundry® platform.

In addition to this exciting news, we also announced our strategic partnership with Capgemini. This new dynamic partnership is formed around a new approach to data access, analytics and big data utility. Visit here &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/businessdatalake&gt; to learn more about how we are co-innovating around big data and analytics to address the increasing volumes of data organizations are facing today. 

As an registered participant of our event, we are giving you exclusive access to the replays of the opening remarks, customer case studies and technology workshop sessions. Stream Paul Maritz&apos;s keynote now &lt;http://gopivotal.com/resources#http://bitcast-a.v1.o1.sjc1.bitgravity.com/greenplum/pivotalvideo/APJ_Paul_Maritz.m4v&gt; before it is made public!
