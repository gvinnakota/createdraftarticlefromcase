FEATURED SESSION with MARK POLLACK AND MARK FISHER

 Develop Powerful Big Data Applications Easily with Spring XD  &lt;https://2014.event.springone2gx.com/schedule/sessions/develop_powerful_big_data_applications_easily_with_spring_xd.html&gt;
 Spring XD aims to provide a one stop shop for writing and deploying Big Data 
Applications. It provides a scalable, fault tolerant, distributed runtime for Data Ingestion, Analytics, and Workflow Orchestration using a single programming, configuration and extensibility model. By not requiring developers to rationalize all of this themselves across the many different solutions available today, Spring XD greatly reduces the inherent complexity of Big Data development. It&apos;s all built on proven projects like Spring Integration, and Spring Batch. You&apos;ll see for yourself how this heritage combines to provide a scalable runtime environment, that is easily configured and assembled via a simple DSL. 

Huge Discount on Immersion Training at the show!

If you select a registration package that includes the $200 two-day Immersion 
Training, you will be contacted to select one of the three options. You must attend only one of the Immersion Trainings for September 7-8, 2014. Day 2 training on September 8, 2014 will end before the official start of activities for SpringOne 2GX 2014.

 This is a one-of-a-kind conference for application developers, solution and data architects who develop business applications, create multi-device aware web applications, process vast quantities of enterprise data, design cloud architectures, and manage high performance infrastructure. The sessions are specifically tailored for developers using the hugely popular open source Spring IO Projects, Groovy &amp; Grails, CloudFoundry, Apache Hadoop and Tomcat technologies. Whether you&apos;re building mission-critical web or business applications, crunching huge amounts of distributed data, or designing the next killer cloud application, SpringOne 2GX will keep you up to date with the latest enterprise technology. 

 Featuring presentations delivered by development leads, committers, and published authors, it&apos;s the ideal place to obtain critical skills to help you design, build and run tomorrow&apos;s software solutions. Plus you&apos;ll meet and learn from open source leaders &lt;https://2014.event.springone2gx.com/presenters&gt; who drive innovation for these technologies.
