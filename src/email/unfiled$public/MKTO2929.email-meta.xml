    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Thanks for visiting us at VMworld 2015. We hope you enjoyed learning how enterprises are adopting cloud native application architectures to drive modern software experiences for their customers.

During the Monday VMworld keynote, we announced intent to deliver Pivotal Cloud Foundry with the VMware Photon Platform as an integrated solution for Cloud Native Applications &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal-cloud-foundry/products/next-gen-cloud-native-platform-vmware-photon-pivotal-cloud-foundry&gt;. This is an exciting moment for us—it signals an important milestone in the evolution of cloud technology. With this solution, companies will fundamentally transform how they deliver and run custom enterprise software for the next decade.
