Success and the Olympic Spirit

 Are you following @Paul_Maritz &lt;https://twitter.com/Paul_Maritz&gt; on Twitter? He sent out his first tweet last week: “Cloud is too important to be proprietary – today we join with @IBM, @HP, @SAP, RAX and others to make this a reality! http://t.co/QbWvzjb6A1 &lt;http://t.co/QbWvzjb6A1&gt;.” So cool! Congrats to the whole Cloud Foundry team and everyone who made this happen!

 This edition of the biweekly Pivotal Newsletter continues the trend from the last publication: 
success. We’re “Making it Happen” in the Americas in the Business Update, in App Fabric and Real Time Intelligence in the Product Update, and in Hadoop and Query Processing in the People Updates.

 The Olympics, an event that reminds us of the importance of teams and teamwork, 
wrapped up last week. If you meet with someone from the field, professional services, engineering, customer success, or anyone else involved in NBCUniversal’s digital ad sales processing at the Olympics, please thank them for their hard work! NBCUniversal expressed their gratitude for our support and partnership 
in keeping their platform running (including Pivotal HD and HAWQ) with optimum performance throughout Olympics, meeting their data delivery SLA every single day.

“Winning is not everything, but wanting to win is.”—Vince Lombardi











BUSINESS UPDATE
Andy O’Brien
 Vice President, Sales Americas







Making it Happen in the Americas!

 The shortest measurement of recorded time is the measurement between a great year-end and the beginning of the 
new year…when we are back to $0. In the Americas, we really enjoyed that iota of a second off! The great news is, there’s a lot to report.

 We implemented a field area model to better support our customers and our growing field force. Please join me in congratulating our new Area Leaders: 


 - Northeast: Joe Ventura (Sales), Tim Coventry-Cox (Field Engineering)
 - Federal: Jonathan McDonald (Sales), Clark Christensen (Field Engineering)
 - South: Tim Kalbas (Sales), James Williams (Field Engineering)
 - Central/West: Rob Schmitt (Sales), Mark Ruesink (Field Engineering)


In addition to setting up these new teams (and their quotas!) we have been refining how we deliver our message to our client base – focused around Pivotal One with our three pillars: PaaS, Data and Agile. It is a powerful message that our customers are quickly embracing.

 I also wanted to give a special shout out to our colleagues at Pivotal Labs. Our increased focus toward the enterprise client is not only generating some amazing revenue and interesting opportunities, it is setting the table for the Pivotal One platform. Pivotal Labs is becoming its own version of Hotel California...you can check out anytime you like, but you never want to leave!

It took only 50 days into 2014 to close not only the largest and most strategic Cloud Foundry deal in history, but also the largest deal in Pivotal 
history! Special thanks to Andrew Ettinger, Ian Andrews, Carlos Castro, James Watters and countless others for leading the charge on this win. No doubt selling is a team sport and this deal took a village! I look forward to seeing many others post eight-figure wins with our amazing products. Finally, we could not do what we do without all of you – the entire extended Pivotal team. Every single employee plays a role when we have success in the field (I know some of you like to hide when we lose a deal!). So, a sincere thanks and virtual toast to all of our sisters and brothers at Pivotal. Thanks for everything you do to help us succeed.











PRODUCT UPDATE
Alexis Richardson
 Head of Product Management,
 App Fabric and Real Time Intelligence (RTI)







Making it Happen in App Fabric and RTI!

App Fabric Update
 Thank you to everyone who attended our Land &amp; Expand Pivotal One Deals with Open Source &amp; Pivotal App Suite &lt;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8gq5KRcTGfWU25sbTVxUEtXRlE/edit?usp=sharing&gt; session at the WWSKO &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/sales-kick-off-2014&gt;. For those who missed it, this session covered the ways App Fabric products solve customer problems and grow small deals into larger deals. On that note, special congratulations goto Brian Lock – who was awarded sales rep of the year 2013 for just such a deal – spinning up a RabbitMQ lead into a full-fledged Pivotal One deal worth over $10M.

 We’d love to see every rep &quot;make it happen&quot; 
with at least one big App Fabric win this year. So please check out the slides, demos and much more at our Inside App Fabric &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal-af/&gt; site! Opportunities are already in play based on what we shared. Don’t forget that these App Dev deals are also an excellent way to bring Pivotal Labs into the mix, because (according to Steve Todd at the EMC CTO office &lt;http://stevetodd.typepad.com/my_weblog/2014/02/coding-speed-for-the-data-analytic-stack.html&gt;) App Fabric is all about improving the speed and agility of software development.

 Through Q2, we’ll implement the Pivotal App Suite SKU, 
providing you with a simpler way to sell App Fabric. Product updates include: 



 - Java application support in our Pivotal CF buildpack and Pivotal tc Server 3.0, with Tomcat 8 &lt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHdyBjb9gbU&gt;, websockets &lt;http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/web-socket-howto.html&gt;, JCA &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_EE_Connector_Architecture&gt; and Pivotal GemFire Cache Spring XD &lt;http://projects.spring.io/spring-xd/&gt; 1.0
 - Spring Boot 1.0 and Pivotal RabbitMQ 3.2.4
 - Redis &lt;http://redis.io/&gt; 3.0, which adds clustering and is commercially supported. 


We’ll also begin to roll out the Spring IO Platform – a major advancement in developer productivity for Pivotal’s applications and data stack.

Real Time Intelligence (RTI) Update
 February was a huge month for RTI. The product led on behalf of Pivotal, VMware and EMC at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona. Vodafone showcased RTI and Pivotal to the world with the only &quot;real-time&quot; demo at the whole conference. You can see an example video here &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/pivotal-real-time/rti4t-go-to-market/mwc-2014&gt;. Big thanks to Tony Parker, Phil Reay and Paul Davey for making it happen with Vodafone 
and MWC.

 The industry is looking for ways to tie customer activity to analytics that drive commerce and we are now front and center. Paul Maritz, Joe Tucci and Jeff Nick were able to meet with 35 customers off the back of MWC and we are in business.

 To quote from Paul’s email: &quot;On the opportunity side, you have a $600B industry that is beginning to realize that it has to make a fundamental shift, 
realizing that they are spending way too much on Cap Ex and Solutions, and they not only don’t, but cannot, address the fundamental issues that they have – customer satisfaction and new revenue sources. They are know that somehow they need to get on to a new platform, but are unsure where to start. We have a huge opportunity to get in and be the seed of the new platform&quot;.

 The RTI platform is built on Spring, Pivotal GemFire and Pivotal RabbitMQ and will converge with Pivotal CF later this year.

 As excited as we are about this, before you press the pedal to the 
floor on new deals please contact Alexis Richardson, Paul Davey and Richard Lamb. RTI is out on limited availability for POCs – full details are here &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/pivotal-real-time/rti4t-go-to-market&gt;. Watch this space for more updates!











PRODUCT UPDATE
Roman Shaposhnik
 Sr. Manager, Hadoop Open Source Platform







Making it Happen with Hadoop!

 I come to work every day pondering how can we channel all the creative energy of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) 
into the success of the Pivotal One platform. Typically, you can find me in Palo Alto, online (flaming on ASF mailing lists) and also networking at various open source conferences throughout the world.

 Currently, I’m working on: 


 - Pivotal HD: I focus on helping our Pivotal Hadoop distribution (Pivotal HD) become the industry’s leading Hadoop distribution (especially in the cloud and on Pivotal One). One of my goals is to turn Pivotal into an esteemed member of the ASF: a #1 employment destination and training ground for committers.
 - ApacheCON 2014: I’ve also been puzzling over outlandish T-shirt designs (if you’ve got one, send it to me!) for ApacheCON 2014 – Pivotal&apos;s debut in the ASF community. 

 - Hadoop Summit US 2014: This is one of the leading conferences for the Apache Hadoop community and the community determines the agenda for this event. Please help Pivotal get our talks &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/document/d/1apdyc-bsK-PKDf59h94n0uqEqs2ATfFMmnmzI3NPtCk/edit?usp=sharing&gt; accepted by voting here &lt;https://hadoopsummit.uservoice.com/&gt;.

 - Meetup in NYC: If you’re in New York on March 20th, stop by the Pivotal Labs office from 5:30-6:30pm for some pizza, networking, and to learn about “The Elephant in the Cloud: A Quest for the Next Generation Hadoop Architecture.” Register on Meetup &lt;http://www.meetup.com/Pivotal-Open-Source-Hub/events/169381212/&gt;.
 - Top Secret!: There&apos;s also a top secret Hadoop-related project. But if I tell you about it, I&apos;ll have to lock you up.


In my spare time…wait, what spare time? My euro board games are a serious business! Something else you probably don’t know about me is that I almost ended up being a surgeon (truth be told: hacking 1s and 0s is way easier than hacking human flesh).

 To me, Pivotal is all 
about Pivotal One. It is a true game changer and something that will make the Big Data market pale in comparison.

 Oh, and by the way, one fact here (and one fact only!) is a fabrication, a tale, a myth, an illusion…well you get the idea. Send me an email &lt;mailto:rshaposhnik@gopivotal.com&gt; to guess what it is. If you’re right, you’ll get a prize.







 




PEOPLE UPDATE
Michalis Petropoulos
 Senior Manager, Data Fabric







Making it Happen with Query Processing!

Building Strong Technical Foundation
 The Query Processing team is responsible for 
optimizing and executing queries on Big Data using the SQL language. Our work is incorporated in the core of both Pivotal HD/HAWQ &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/big-data/pivotal-hd&gt; and Pivotal Greenplum Database &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/big-data/pivotal-greenplum-database&gt; (GPDB). We are a team of eleven developers, supported by five QA engineers. During the last year, we managed to add three recent PhD graduates to our team, as well as an experienced engineer from Google. In the short term, our projects focus on addressing current customer pain points. We also work to help solve hard problems, in collaboration with other engineering teams, which will provide long-term competitive advantage to Pivotal.

Pivotal Query Optimizer (aka Orca)
 Building an optimizer from scratch is probably the most challenging project 
a database company can undertake. Greenplum made this decision a few years ago. Today, the new Pivotal Query Optimizer &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/groups/94234-orcaqueryoptimizer&gt; is deployed in HAWQ and has been tested by existing customers in GPDB. Architected to serve both products at the same time, the Pivotal Query Optimizer provides significant performance gains, addresses chronic customer pain points and can be extended to accommodate future developments in the Hadoop arena.

Reliable and Fast Query 
Execution
 We are currently working on a roadmap to address resource consumption during query execution and implementing techniques to accelerate query execution, such as Workfile Caching &lt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6547425&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6547425&gt;.

Resource Management
 How many nodes can a query utilize, given the 
current state of the cluster? Put differently, how much parallelism can a query achieve? In collaboration with two other engineering teams, we are trying to scale HAWQ in unprecedented ways.

Research Community
 The Query Processing team will be presenting two 
papers on the Pivotal Query Optimizer at SIGMOD 2014 &lt;http://www.sigmod2014.org/&gt;, the most prestigious database conference. The Beijing team, led by Lei Chang, will present a third paper on HAWQ. Pivotal is sponsoring the conference and will participate in the associated recruiting events.











HELLO, MY NAME IS…
Lei Chang
 Manager, HAWQ Development Team







At Pivotal, I…
 spend each day working with developers, QA, product managers, field engineers and the customer support team. I appreciate the passion, innovative thinking and &quot;one team&quot; working style that these groups exemplify. 

You can find me…
 either working on daily development in Pivotal Beijing office, or meeting with colleagues in the Palo Alto office. 

Currently, I’m working on…
 HAWQ – a new and exciting product that is a massively parallel processing SQL engine sitting on top of HDFS. I also have the privilege of leading the talented development team that initiated the product.

 The latest news is the team-authored HAWQ architecture paper, which was accepted by the top database conference, SIGMOD. It is entitled: “HAWQ: A Massively Parallel Processing SQL Engine in Hadoop.” I’d like to congratulate the team members for their hard work and I also want to congratulate our peer Orca team for their two SIGMOD papers, related to the new optimizer, which is used by 
both GPDB and HAWQ. All three of the papers we submitted this year were accepted! 

In my spare time…
 I like traveling, reading, sports and spending as much time with my family as possible. 

Something you probably don’t know about me…
 Don’t be surprised if I am a little aggressive on new product features due to my background in research, before R&amp;D. :-) 

To me, Pivotal…
 is company with talented people, great vision, leading edge technologies and exciting market opportunities.
