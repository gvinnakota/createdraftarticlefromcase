    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Sorry we missed you today, Nov. 5th, at the Washington, DC Cloud Platform Roadshow.

It has been brought to our attention that a few attendees received a registration confirmation in August that listed an incorrect date of Thursday Nov. 6.

If you have relied on that earlier communication and planned on attending Nov 6th, we are very sorry for the miscommunication. We will be back in DC soon.

Additionally, we will make the roadshow video recordings available to you as soon as possible.

Again, we are sorry for the inconvenience.

Best,
The Pivotal Team</textOnly>
