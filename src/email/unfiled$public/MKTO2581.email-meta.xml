    <subject>Pivotal Web Services: Important Changes to Buildpacks</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear PWS Application Developer,

Recent versions of various Cloud Foundry buildpacks have removed support for older versions of binary dependencies. This was done not only to reduce the sizes of buildpacks, thereby making CF deployment less painful for operators, but also to ensure that a default CF installation doesn&apos;t contain insecure or unsupported versions of application runtimes. Please see this announcement &lt;https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/buildpack-packager/issues/4&gt; for more background on the motivation for this decision.

On June 25, 2015, updates to the latest Pivotal Web Services system buildpack versions will include fewer supported runtimes and libraries:

Why is this important

Applications that specify or rely on binary dependencies that are no longer included in the buildpack will fail to deploy.

Existing applications that were deployed using a previous buildpack version and specify or depend on binary dependencies that are no longer included will continue to run but will fail to re-deploy.

A typical example of an error message in this situation is as follows:
Could not get translated url, exited with: 
DEPENDENCY_MISSING_IN_MANIFEST: https://path/to/ruby-2.1.0.tgz 

What you should do

If your application specifies or depends on a binary dependency that is supported in the new buildpack versions listed above, you do not need to take any further action.

If your application specifies or depends on a binary dependency that is no longer supported, please refer to this knowledge base article &lt;http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.run.pivotal.io%2Fentries%2F82311705-What-runtime-language-and-server-versions-are-support-for-a-build-pack-&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGnGGWIDAcviC8wgayuOZW1krZduQ&gt; for instructions.

Please contact support@run.pivotal.io &lt;mailto:support@run.pivotal.io&gt; if you have any questions.

Sincerely,
 The Pivotal Web Services Team
