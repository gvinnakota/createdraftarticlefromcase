Pivotal Catalyst Partner Program
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Thank you again for your interest in the Pivotal Catalyst Partner Program.  We have approved the application for [Jaspersoft] to participate in the program as a Registered Member.

At this time, we are in the process of rolling out tools and information for Catalyst Program participants that will enable you to get the most out of your relationship with Pivotal.  Please stay tuned in the coming weeks and months - you will be hearing much more from us.

Thank you again for your interest in the Catalyst Partner Program.  We look forward to working with you in the future. 

Sincerely,

The Pivotal Business Development Team

David Menninger and Jim Totte
