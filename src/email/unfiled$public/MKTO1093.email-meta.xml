    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

We&apos;re sorry you weren&apos;t able to join us for our customer webinar &quot;Enabling Personalized Healthcare with Biomedical Informatics&quot; last Wednesday, August 27, 2014 with 
Aridhia. 

Our webinar explored how Aridhia is using Pivotal technology to maximize the potential of existing data within the healthcare system, enabling healthcare providers to inform clinical outcomes from insights gained from complex datasets, and providing a data science safe 
haven that promotes collaboration between healthcare, academia and industry.

Want to know more? We invite you to watch the replay here &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/big-data/hadoop/customer-case-study/pivotal-hadoop-and-aridhia-revolutionize-healthcare&gt; or visit our website &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/big-data&gt; to learn more about how Pivotal Big 
Data solutions can help your organization harness data in a more intelligent and effective way.
 
Thank you,
