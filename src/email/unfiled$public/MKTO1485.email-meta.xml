This is a reminder to please join us tomorrow as we host EMC CEO Joe Tucci, and the EMC Board for a Town Hall gathering at our Palo Alto, Deer Creek office.  

If you are in the Bay Area, please join our live audience in Palo Alto at 9 A.M. pacific. The event will also be streamed live &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/employee-information/pivotal-town-hall&gt; via Inside Pivotal (the replay will be available on Inside Pivotal after the event, for those who are with customers or otherwise cannot attend). 

This is a rare opportunity to hear from Joe and the EMC Board, and engage with him and the Board directly in an informal dialogue. Bring your questions!
