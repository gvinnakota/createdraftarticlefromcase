FEATURED SESSION WITH OLIVER GIERKE
 &lt;https://2015.event.springone2gx.com/schedule/sessions/what_s_new_in_2015_for_spring_data.html&quot;&gt;What&gt;
 
 A year has passed and the Spring Data shipped two release train iterations packed with interesting features. This talk will give a broad overview of the most important introduced in the Fowler and Gosling release trains. We will cover recent additions and improvements in Spring Data Commons - the module that&apos;s shared amongst the store specific ones. We&apos;ll then delve into the latest and greatest features of individual store modules, like JPA, MongoDB and the community ones as well.

Pre-Conference Training by Pivotal Education
 
Pivotal Education offers a series of accelerated, hands-on training workshops prior to the SpringOne conference. Sessions are scheduled two full days before the conference begins (September 13-14) and provide students with an opportunity to receive in-depth training on some of the latest Pivotal technologies. Courses run from 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. both days. Sessions will not overlap with any conference activities. Training workshops are $400 per student. Price includes 2-day training workshop and $50 gift card (to be allocated for breakfast, lunch and breaks during the 2 days) Your preferred workshop can be selected during registration for SpringOne 2GX. Space is limited.
 
Course #1: Developing Applications with Cloud Foundry
This 2-day workshop is designed for application developers responsible for working with and deploying deploy Java/Spring applications on Cloud Foundry. Students will gain familiarity in CF concepts (applications, buildpacks, manifests, organizations, spaces, users, roles, domains, routes, services), how to push applications to CF (various languages), services, user provided services, manifests, YAML, environment variables, autoconfiguration, logging and loggregator, VCAP_SERVICES and VCAP_APPLICATION.
 
Course #2: Spring XD
This 2-day workshop is designed for developers and architects responsible for leveraging Spring XD for data ingestion in a Big Data environment. Through hands-on labs, the course explores installation and administration of Spring XD, usage of the Spring XD Shell, creating, configuring, deploying, and scaling streams and jobs and the development of custom modules. Students will learn how to configure the product for various deployment scenarios, including high availability and distributed mode.

Course #3: Building the Connected Car 
 At the 2014 SpringOne conference, attendees were introduced to the Connected Car, a demonstration of a solution built with Spring and Pivotal products aimed at the Internet of Things. In this all-new 2-day workshop, we will allow attendees to walk through the architectural components of the Connected Car and receive hands-on experience building various parts of the architecture. At the end of the workshop, attendees will understand where various technologies fit architecturally as well as a basic understanding of how to implement those technologies in a solution.
