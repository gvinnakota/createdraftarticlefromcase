Pivotal’s New Domain Extension – Notify Your Customers with this Customizable Email Template

On Monday morning (PST) 28 July, Pivotal will publicly launch a new domain extension, www.pivotal.io &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/&gt;.

As part of this, all Pivotal Labs e-mail addresses will now become become: “username@pivotal.io” Take note that the Pivotal Labs (www.pivotallabs.com) and Pivotal Tracker (http://www.pivotaltracker.com &lt;http://www.pivotaltracker.com/&gt;) websites and social properties will not change.

To notify your customers/opportunity contacts of your new email and the new “.io” domain, we have created customizable email templates, available on the links below.
