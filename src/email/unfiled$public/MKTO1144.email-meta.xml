    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Thanks so much for joining us for our executive event. It was great to see so many VMware and Pivotal customers come together to chat about the synergy between VMware and Pivotal solutions. With Pivotal CF, the leading enterprise PaaS cloud platform powered by Cloud Foundry, and VMware infrastructure products, you can build modern cloud platforms.

If you are looking for ways to take your VMware infrastructure further and build a modern cloud platform, please check this page out &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/pivotal-vmware-cloud ?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=pivotal-email-link&amp;utm_campaign=vmware-target-account&gt;. If you have any questions or would like a Pivotal representative to contact you, please email us at info@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:info@pivotal.io&gt; or visit our contact page &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/contact&gt;.

 Lastly, we are bringing the Cloud
