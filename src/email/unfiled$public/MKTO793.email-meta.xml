    <subject>Cloud Foundry Summit – A Pivotal Thanks!</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;http://cfsummit.com/&gt;
Hello!
Thank you for visiting the Pivotal booth during the CF Summit.
Here at Pivotal, we believe that Platform as a Service (PaaS) makes it much easier to deploy, run and scale applications and Cloud Foundry® is the industry’s leading Open PaaS and provides a choice of clouds, frameworks and application services.
Pivotal CF &lt;http://www.gopivotal.com/platform-as-a-service/pivotal-cf&gt;®, the world’s leading enterprise PaaS powered by Cloud Foundry, has recently added new enterprise-grade capabilities:


 - Ability to automatically deploy applications into dual availability zones to build in redundancy across clouds
 - Enhanced dashboards for real time application status, events, and logs
 - Ability for operations to create service plans for binding apps to existing enterprise data lakes
 - Developer data services for building next-gen apps


These capabilities support the speed and flexibility needed by application development teams, and the scalability, reliability, and control required by IT operations teams to deliver a new class of modern applications.
Check us out at out GigaOM Structure &lt;http://events.gigaom.com/structure-2014/&gt; in SF this week and see what Scott Yara &lt;http://events.gigaom.com/structure-2014/session/is-being-multi-cloud-even-possible/&gt;, Pivotal’s President and Head of Products, has to say about PaaS &lt;http://events.gigaom.com/structure-2014/session/is-being-multi-cloud-even-possible/&gt;.
Thanks!
