    <subject>Making Pivotal a Special Place to Work</subject>
    <textOnly>At Pivotal, we have a unique opportunity to make a positive difference and to create a special workplace. It takes a lot to come together as quickly as we have, but we are beginning to see that collectively we have all of the talent and tools needed to help define a new generation of computing.

It is 
critical along the way to get your views on our progress. Starting in September we’ll launch our first company-wide Pivotal Pulse survey, which we’ll conduct on a regular basis, to get your views and insights on our business and your place in it.

The survey will include questions on the Pivotal strategy, your work environment, and on the work you do. All of your responses are confidential, so please be candid in your answers. We will review and use these responses as a guide to improving Pivotal.

We have retained the firm Sirota &lt;http://www.sirota.com/&gt;, a respected top-tier survey research company that has been conducting employee surveys for over 40 years, to assist us.

You’ll hear 
more from Joe Militello shortly on how Pivotal Pulse will work. Your voice matters, and we need to hear it. We will also share a summary of the survey results in a timely manner.

Thank you,</textOnly>
