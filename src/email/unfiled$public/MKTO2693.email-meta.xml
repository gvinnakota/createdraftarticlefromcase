    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Did we meet you, or did you hear from us at Devoxx UK &lt;http://www.devoxx.co.uk/&gt;?  We’re coming to conferences like Devoxx to specifically to help developers learn that cloud-native application architectures aren’t just available to pioneers like Netflix anymore - Spring and Cloud Foundry are making it accessible.  Grab a free copy of the 50 page concept primer from O&apos;Reilly - “Migrating to Cloud Native Application Architecture &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=pov-newsletter-7-7-15&gt;”. 

If you weren&apos;t able to catch our talks, cool schwag, or technology, here’s a quick recap:


 


 - Dr. Dave Syer showed developers how NetFlixOSS components are being integrated into the Spring programming model with “Microservices made easy with Spring Cloud”. 
 - Josh Long showed us the container at base of the Spring microservice stack, Spring Boot in his talk   “Bootiful Applications with Spring Boot”. 

 - Familiar with Kubernetes or Mesos?  Great!  Download Lattice.cf &lt;http://lattice.cf&gt; today and get started with Spring Cloud via vagrant on your local machine or via AWS, using Cloud Foudry’s advanced 
“diego” scheduler, self-healing, http load balancer, and log aggregation.



If NetflixOSS gets you excited about the future, make sure to learn more now:
