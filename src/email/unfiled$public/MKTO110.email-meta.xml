Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Pivotal HD™ &lt;http://gopivotal.com/apj&gt; provides a foundation for change – a platform that addresses the complexity and implementation costs of Hadoop and enhancing it with the expressive power of Structured Query Language (SQL). It taps into vast amounts of data to provide organizations with insights that can be used to discover new business value.
 &lt;http://gopivotal.com/apj&gt;

SQL is an extremely powerful and widely adopted way to manipulate and understand data. Until now, Hadoop&apos;s SQL capability has been limited and impractical for many. Pivotal HD is the new benchmark for SQL on Hadoop - the most functionally-rich, mature and robust offering available.
