    <textOnly>Team:

I am pleased to share that Raghvender Arni will be taking on a new role and charter as Senior Director of Platform Strategy, reporting directly to me. Arni has most recently worked in the Field Organization, where he ran Field Engineering in the NY/NJ region, and was also working with the Product and Marketing teams in shaping product roadmaps and our Go To Market. 

In his new role, Arni will collaborate closely with the leaders of our Business Teams to establish a cohesive platform strategy, in partnership with other functional areas like Sales, Marketing, Business Development, and Strategic Services, to ensure the successful execution of that strategy.

For those who are not aware of Arni&apos;s background prior to his recent years in the Field, he started his career at Bell-Labs Research after graduate school, and went on to found a venture-funded startup, ran Engineering, followed by Product Management. He&apos;s been here since the founding of Pivotal, joining us from VMWare.

I&apos;m pleased to have someone of Arni&apos;s caliber to head up this important charter.
