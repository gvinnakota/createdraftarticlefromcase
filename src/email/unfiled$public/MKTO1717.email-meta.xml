 DCA Q4 Sales Enablement
 Last week, EMC/Isilon announced to their field organization that Isilon Account Executives and Field Engineers would receive quota relief and commission credit for the EMC Data Computing Appliance (DCA) during Q4 of 2014. Isilon had not previously compensated its sales teams on the DCA. With this announcement, Isilon is now positively incentivized to drive Pivotal data products into their accounts via the DCA. 

 Q4 SPIF for Isilon Field Reps/FEs
 Through Q4 2014, Pivotal will sponsor a sales incentive program with Isilon’s field organization for our software products. Under the program, Isilon account executives and field engineers will be eligible for a $5,000 sales incentive bonus for selling or assisting in standalone software sales of the Pivotal Hadoop distribution with HAWQ, and Pivotal’s Big Data Suite. Details on the program can be found in the FAQ on the Inside Pivotal Alliance &lt;http://info.pivotal.io/c0o029DI0NAU04CJp0dEY00&gt; home page.

 We are pleased to announce the availability of the first and brand new Pivotal Master Price List (MPL). This tool, which replaces the product and services availably guide, is meant to be comprehensive and help the quote creation process. It includes the main SKUs and pricing used for Direct, EMC and VMW quotes, as well as UOM definitions, inclusions, restrictions, pre-requisites and migrations. Please always consult the latest MPL before making any quote. It is available online as a Google sheet or as a downloadable and printable excel spreadsheet. 

To get you started, we have developed an FAQ &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/document/d/1lomgyj1z0J0-sC8eiFZOjOBpBCSYYb0J_K53z_dI8JM/edit&gt;. We also hosted a Spotlight Webinar on Monday, October 6th and Thursday October 9th to give you an overview of the new tool and answer any question you might have. Questions?

production later this month.
