    <subject>Important Info - Erroneous Blazemeter Message</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear PWS User,

Recently you may have received an email from Pivotal Web Services concerning the Blazemeter service. Due to a bug in our system the email wasn&apos;t appropriately marked as an email from a PWS third-party service: Blazemeter. It is possible that you have not used the Blazemeter service in the past, but your email was included as you were a user in a Cloud Foundry space in which some users have used Blazemeter in the past. In addition, your email was not shared with any third party as part of this erroneous mailing.

We apologize for the confusion.

Best Regards,
Charles Wu
