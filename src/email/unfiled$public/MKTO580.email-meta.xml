    <textOnly>Intro to Apache Tomcat 8
Speakers: Daniel Mikusa and Stuart Williams

Apache Tomcat 8 implements new versions of the Servlet, JSP and EL specifications as well as adding support for the new WebSocket specification. Work has also been completed on internal refactoring in a number of areas that will impact a number of Tomcat specific features.

This presentation will provide an overview of the changes and new features introduced by both the updated specifications and the Tomcat specific changes. This session will enable attendees to identify the Tomcat 8 features of greatest interest to them and provide them with the information required to start planning their migration to Tomcat 8.

Spring Data Repositories â€“ Best Practices
Speakers: Oliver Gierke and Thomas Darimont

The repository abstraction layer is one of the core pieces of the Spring Data projects. It provides a consistent, interface-based programming model to allow implementing data access layers easily for relational and NoSQL databases.

We will have a look at the lessons learned from the application of it in various customer projects and summarize best practices for you to apply in your projects. The session will also discuss advanced features like the Querydsl integration, the integration of custom implementation code as well as hooks into Spring MVC and Spring HATEOAS.
