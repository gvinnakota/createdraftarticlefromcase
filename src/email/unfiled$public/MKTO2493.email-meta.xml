A Message from Greg Stroud
MAY 2015 SALES NEWS FLASH
Global Field Operations Team,

Please take the time to read this communication carefully; as there are Compensation, SFDC, Callidus and Product updates that you should be aware of.

The Next Evolution in Software Sales
Subscription sales are a vital part of our business and to compete with an evolving market we have made great strides in re-engineering our systems. In Q3 (July 20th) we will be introducing a new Subscription Platform! The Subscription Platform will enable Pivotal teams - from Platform, to Data, to Pivotal Labs - to sell directly to customers with ease. Salesforce will get a brand new quoting module that enables Sales Reps to quote direct, EMC, and VMware deals independently. DxP will only be used for EMC Sales moving forward.  Trainings will be available in early July.  More details to come!

What’s in it for Sales?


 - Easier to sell subscription bundles &amp; options with the ability to amend, upsell, and renew subscriptions (adding quantities, new products, modifying the subscription term)! 
 - Quote direct deals exclusively in Pivotal systems, when applicable.
 - PDF quote generation for easy handoff to customers and partners (EMC and VMware).
 - CRM visibility for better customer management.
 - No more BI Reports, new system-based Bookings and Commissions reporting.


 
Still Time to Make More Money with the 1H Quota SPIF
As a reminder, Sales Reps, ISRs and Field Engineers* who are on a Pivotal commission plan, have signed a 2015 Goal Acknowledgment Form (GAF) and are full-time regular employees of Pivotal on the booking date are eligible for a SPIF of 10% 1H Variable OTE for making 1H quota during the Effective Dates. Payable August 2015. Detail on the 1H Quota SPIF may be found here &lt;https://emccorp.webex.com/emccorp/ldr.php?RCID=e6324afc1363d44733e3d755e622ed40&gt;.

Compensation Tool (Callidus) Updates
May compensation reports will be available and visible in Callidus by May 29th.  Have a question on your commissions or reports? Within Callidus, click “Quick Tasks--&gt;Submit a Request” and a member of the compensation team will be in touch with you.

Federation Updates
KEY FEDERATION WIN
Pivotal and VMware recently closed an important IoT deal with Tyco, the $11billion dollar fire and security 
company.  The deal is for over $800K of PCF and $600K of vCloud Air.

Tyco is an important deal for VMware as it demonstrates that vCloud Air can win against AWS and Azure.  Tyco is, of course, a significant user of vSphere and other VMware products. 

There is a great webex interview with Mike Polick of Pivotal and Dean Tomaino of VMware, where they describe how the deal was won and the importance of working closely together. Check it out here &lt;https://emccorp.webex.com/emccorp/ldr.php?RCID=e6324afc1363d44733e3d755e622ed40&gt;.

FEDERATION ACCOUNT PLANNING 

EMC and VMware are hosting meetings around the world to align resources on key accounts.  These meetings can be overwhelming for Pivotal because we are more resource constrained than our Federation partners.  So is account planning with the Federation worth your time?

There is a growing awareness in the Federation that Pivotal is the driver for large deals.   As a result, sales teams at VMware and EMC are looking for opportunities to introduce you into their engagements.  Enterprise customers that buy into Pivotal Labs are the customers that spend $M on PCF and on BDS, and more $M on both VMware and EMC products. Not every sales team at VMware or EMC understand this yet, but those that do are worth your time.

Watch out for invitations to the Federation account planning.  If you have questions please contact Craig Steel (who covers EMC) or Angus MacDonald (who covers VMware). 

Upcoming meetings:



 - May 20th - Seattle : Nordstrom, T-mobile, Expedia
 - June 2nd - Minneapolis : Thomson Reuters, 3M, Cargill, Best Buy. Target, Delta Airlines, General Mills
 - June 4th - Palo Alto : Salesforce, eBay, Seagate, Adobe, LinkedIn, Visa


SFDC – What’s New
To support Pivotal&apos;s named account strategy, the Salesforce team recently implemented LeanData, which is a SFDC add-on that performs two very important functions: Tagging and Routing.

Tagging:


 - When a Lead enters SFDC, LeanData attempts to fuzzy match the new Leads to existing Accounts using the Leads name, email company, etc.
 - If a match is made, the related Account’s attributes are copied over to the Lead record
 - Users can now see Account details by Lead &amp; Leads by Account


Routing:
 


 - If LeanData matches a Lead to a “Named” Account, the Lead will be assigned to the matched Account’s ISR (AMER &amp; EMEA) or Account Owner (APJ).
 - Account ISR assignment is based on the Account Owner’s Region.
 - Now ISRs (AMER &amp; EMEA) and Account Owners (APJ) will receive all the Leads related to the Named Accounts they support, even if the Lead&apos;s location is not in their set list of states/countries.


New LeanData sections are available on the following pages:  Lead, Account, Contact &amp; Opportunity.  Additional details can be found here &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/presentation/d/1J-LFcj4hAqqt9yjSOfbFi3bgw0V5Tv26kxMtixeRvE4/edit?usp=sharing&gt;.

Product Updates
OSS Support for Apache HTTP. By popular demand, Pivotal will continue to support open source Apache HTTP server. We recently announced an EOL for Pivotal Web Server. That EOL will proceed as scheduled. However, the end of Apache HTTP support that accompanied that announcement has been rescinded. Pivotal will continue support for Apache HTTP in the Pivotal App Suite. This means that all customers of Pivotal Web Server now have an alternative, and can continue to receive support from Pivotal by moving to open source Apache HTTP Server. For more information, please contact dcarwin@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:dcarwin@pivotal.io&gt;.

New Data SKUs
As of May 11, 2015, Pivotal has released the following sets of Data SKUs through the EMC / Direct channel:

 
 

 



 - Non Production BDS SKUs: this new set of SKUs allows the sales of BDS for non-production purpose only. The price for this offering is $500 / Core / year and can be sold on 1-, 2- and 3-year terms. The same changes applied at VMware on  April 1, 2015.
 - GPDB stand-alone perpetual SKUs: in order to simplify the pricing and quoting process of GPDB stand-alone SKUs, we combined the 11 tiers into one, with a list price of $25,000 / Terabyte. These SKUs should be used solely for existing GPDB customers who wish to add capacity. Since BDS should be the only sales motion for subscription offerings, we did not perform the same simplification on the GPDB subscription SKUs.
 



 

Please contact product_ops@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:product_ops@pivotal.io&gt; or data-prod-marketing@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:data-prod-marketing@pivotal.io&gt; if you have questions regarding these changes.

PivotalR
PivotalR is a feature of GPDB and HAWQ that was released in May 2014. It enables users of R to interact with the GPDB  and PHD/HAWQ for Big Data analytics and also serves as a wrapper for MadLib. It is distributed via CRAN &lt;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PivotalR/index.html&gt; (“Comprehensive R Archive Network”) using 
a GPL license (Open Source) and through a builtin support in the R package manager. Until recently, PivotalR was unsupported.

We are pleased to announce that effective immediately, GPDB, HAWQ and BDS customers will be able to log a ticket via Zendesk and receive support using Pivotal’s standard SLA. For more questions, please contact fmcquillan@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:fmcquillan@pivotal.io&gt;.

Services SKU Updates
As of May 11, 2015, Pivotal has introduced new EMC models for the TAM (Technical Account Manager), an offering delivered by the Pivotal 
Customer Success Organization (CSO). These models will be used for deals on EMC and Pivotal papers throughout Q2 and can be found on EMC price list and Pivotal Master Price List &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/spreadsheets/d/1tfFpOi4NTyISBeQFI4S8WHnIAjddGxQ3goN5Z-Kc-3Q/edit#gid=2142108625&gt;.
For more information about the new models, please consult the FAQ &lt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PHDZBQqQknQrai0M9Qd-pm20lLbRxj33Dm_EXpzQi_0/edit&gt; or contact dpitek@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:dpitek@pivotal.io&gt;.

 

Reference Updates
Pivotal had more client 
speakers at the annual CF Summit in Santa Clara than any of our competitors. Twelve enterprises made keynote speeches about how Pivotal has helped them succeed with their business. Clients included Lockheed Martin, General Electric, Comcast and our frequent champion, Corelogic. Additionally, six of these clients also agreed to film video segments and take part in case studies, which will greatly help our business, and present our clients as the leaders in their field.

 

The first quarter of 2015 was the best Q1 in Pivotal&apos;s history, with big gains in Data and Labs. Learn about 18 of our biggest Q1 wins on the Customer Marketing Page &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/customer-marketing-and-programs/assets/external-slides&gt;.

Academy (i.e. library of online training modules), Education-specific collateral, and more. 

Check out both links on the Field Operations Inside 
Pivotal page and discover how Pivotal Education can help accelerate your customer’s adoption and success of Pivotal products.

 

The Customer Info App - Account Info At 
Your Fingertips! 
As demoed at the Sales Kickoff in February &lt;https://drive.google.com/a/pivotal.io/file/d/0B1rVqn9ifV69ekZkUmpnUHF4Wm8/view&gt; the Customer Info App provides field teams with a 360-degree view of customer account activity, including forecast opportunities, and historical view of product installations and customer support activity.  By combining the capabilities of the Big Data Suite, Pivotal CF, and Pivotal Labs, the app also serves as a great sales tool to show customers the power of Pivotal portfolio.

 

 

 





 

The app is being launched to the field this week for iOS and Android devices.  Be on the lookout for a launch communication from Todd Paoletti, as well as announcements and install instructions on the Customer Info App page on Socialcast &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/groups/121820-customerinfoapp&gt;.
