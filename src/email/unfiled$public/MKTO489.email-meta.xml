    <subject>Spring Webinars: Building &apos;Bootiful&apos; Applications, Connecting Eclipse to the Cloud using Flux &amp; Web App Diagnostics with Java and Javascript</subject>
    <textOnly>Building &apos;Bootiful&apos;Â­ Applications with Spring Boot
Alright, so maybe &quot;bootiful&quot; won&apos;t ever work, but I tried, and it was worth it too because you&apos;re reading this. Spring Boot, the new convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring&apos;s flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development not just fly, but pleasant! 
 
 Join Spring developer advocate Josh Long for a look at what Spring Boot is, why it&apos;s turning heads, why you should consider it for your next application (REST, micro services, web, batch, big data, integration, whatever!) and how to get started.

Connecting Eclipse to the Cloud-Based Era of Developer Tooling with Project Flux
The Eclipse IDE (as one example) is great, but increasingly we are seeing new projects and companies working in the cloud-based developer tooling space, using a front-end that runs purely in the browser. The Eclipse Orion project is one example of this. While the new approaches look promising, they are usually completely disconnected from the existing desktop-class IDEs and are still lightyears away from working well for Java developers.

In this webinar we will provide a sneak peek into Project Flux, a new project that is hosted at Eclipse and that we&apos;ve been working on that aims at bridging this gap between existing desktop-class IDEs and future cloud-based developer tooling. While this project is still far away from shipping a ready-to-use release, the webinar provides an insight into the prototype and what is coming in the future.

Web Application Diagnostics with Java and Javascript
There is more and more usage of Javascript on the client side today. Many are starting down the difficult path of full blown application development in JS on the client side, going beyond having a simple rollover menu logic or presentation component. But tracking and tracing effectively means looking at the whole application, not just the front end. New Relic can be used either in development or production to diagnose hybrid Javascript/Java applications. 
 
In this session, Josh Long (Pivotal) and Ashley Puls (New Relic) will show how you can track and trace your way through today&apos;s hybrid Javascript+Java web apps - resolving slow page loads, blocked threads, slow queries, etc.
