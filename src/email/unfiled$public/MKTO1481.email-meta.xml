    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Building better software, faster, is key to staying competitive. But existing monolithic applications, legacy platforms, and lengthy deployment cycles are holding innovation back.  

Microservices are becoming the cloud architecture of choice for making continuous innovation possible. 

Join &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/microservices-and-paas-a-match-made-in-the-cloud&gt; RedMonk analyst Donnie Berkholz &lt;https://twitter.com/dberkholz&gt; and Pivotal Cloud Architect Matt Stine &lt;https://twitter.com/mstine&gt; to learn how a microservices approach, working in concert with new cloud platforms and a DevOps culture, is the engine that drives innovation at speed.
