 Modern Component Design with Spring Framework 4.2 &lt;https://2015.event.springone2gx.com/schedule/sessions/modern_java_component_design_with_spring_4_2.html&gt;
 
 Spring&apos;s programming and configuration model has a strong design philosophy with 
respect to application components and configuration artifacts. Spring&apos;s annotation-based component story is fine-tuned for source code readability as well as consistency across an entire application&apos;s codebase. This session presents selected Spring Framework 4 component model highlights, with a focus on the upcoming Spring Framework 4.2 and a selection of Java 8 enabled features, illustrated with many code examples and noteworthy design considerations.
