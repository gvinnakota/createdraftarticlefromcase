    <textOnly>Team,

We continued to build momentum in Q2 with strong sales in Pivotal CF and our first sales of the Big Data Suite. The quarter also saw our first deals on Pivotal Paper. As in past quarters, we took our best Big Data Suite/PHD+ and Pivotal CF stories &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/customer-marketing-and-programs/assets/external-slides&gt; to create external-facing (anonymous) business case slides, and more detailed internal &quot;win stories&quot; around them, for all of you to use and learn from.

The business case slides are fully scripted in the presentation notes, and can be added to any pitch decks. The internal-only win stories, contain full transcripts of the sales representativesâ€™ interviews in the notes. Those notes cover lessons learned and details on what competitors said and did.  

Please share any feedback on these slides with Sophia Tseng &lt;mailto:stseng@pivotal.io&gt; and Neela Chaudhari &lt;mailto:nchaudhari@pivotal.io&gt;.

Make it 
happen!</textOnly>
