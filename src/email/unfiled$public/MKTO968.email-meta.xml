The explosion of big data and the rapid evolution of tools and technologies is challenging IT to meet the demands of business users with limited resources. As companies budget for big data initiatives, traditional data strategies such as overbuying to avoid business disruption or culling data that isn’t perceived as useful — are impractical and unrealistic. To get business value from all of information collected, companies need technologies that enable them to experiment while limiting their financial exposure.
