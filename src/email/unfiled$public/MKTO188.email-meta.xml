    <subject>Spring Webinars: Reactor, Spring with Immutability and the Spring eXchange 2013 - London, UK</subject>
    <textOnly>Reactor
Speaker: Jon Brisbin

Reactor is a succinct and powerful foundational library for building reactive, fastdata applications on the JVM. Although it is part of the Spring IO platform, the core Reactor libraries have no dependency on Spring.  Above the core library, there&apos;s direct support for the Disruptor via the high-speed Processor abstraction which provides a Reactor API over the RingBuffer, first-class support for the high-performance JavaChronicle persistent message-passing library through the flexible PersistentQueue 
abstraction, first-class support for Groovy closures and @CompileStatic, high-performance TCP client and server support based on Netty 4.0, powerful annotation-based Spring support, and much more. 

Join Jon Brisbin at the event to get introduced to the first major GA release of Reactor, and learn how Reactor&apos;s Promise and Stream APIs are used to wrangle the inherent complexity of asynchronous, 
event-driven application code.

Spring with Immutability
Speakers: Matt Stine

Readers of Josh Bloch&apos;s &quot;Effective Java&quot; are sometimes perplexed when they reach Item #15: &quot;Minimize Mutability.&quot; If we are to minimize mutability, then obviously we must maximize immutability. While all Java programmers utilize immutable objects every day (e.g. java.lang.String), when asked to create our own immutable classes, we often hesitate. However, if we push through this hesitation, we&apos;ll reap the benefits of simpler reasoning about program correctness, free thread safety, and other benefits.

One of the primary issues faced by enterprise Java programmers seeking to utilize immutable classes are framework issues. Enterprise frameworks from Spring to Hibernate have varying levels of support for immutability, ranging from decent to nonexistent. However, there several practical solutions available to the Spring developer, and this session will illuminate what&apos;s available.
