    <textOnly>CI on the Cloud with Jenkins, Spring and Cloud Foundry
Speaker: Jamie Oâ€™Meara, Pivotal

This presentation will highlight an integrated development process that involves Spring code built with CloudBees Jenkins Enterprise and deployed to CloudFoundry. A software lifecycle of continuous delivery from source code control (Git) to Jenkins build (Maven and Gradle) to live deployment on a Cloud Foundry instance will be shown.

We will demo using Jenkins to do a blue/green application deployment. With a Cloud Foundry blue/green Jenkins deployment, you can push a new version of the application and have a software router add that to an existing version of the application&apos;s route. The two versions are then load-balanced, allowing for testing of the new version and easy replacement or fall-back to the existing version. Developers can run builds on private and public clouds with deploy to either/both Jenkins running on a PaaS and integrated into the PaaS. We will run a hands-on demo and show the beauty and simplicity of an integrated build pipeline with Spring, Jenkins and Cloud Foundry.

Apache Geode (incubating) Clubhouse #2 - Secret Sauce for Network Partition-Tolerance in Apache Geode
Speaker: Bruce Schuchardt, Pivotal

Meet other developers and contributors of Apache Geode (incubating) at the next Apache Geode Clubhouse virtual meeting. 
 Our agenda:

 - How Geode handles network partitions through its distributed membership feature: Geode&apos;s quorum algorithm quickly detects these problems and suspends nodes in a losing partition. 
 - These suspended nodes will later reconnect and resynch with the rest of the system once the network is healed. 
 - Demo of Geode operating in a network partition simulation 
 - Code walk through of Apache Geode showing how this is implemented 
 - Open Q&amp;A

Register for the meeting and we&apos;ll send you log-in instructions, a reminder, and a link to its recording.

JSTL to Thymeleaf: Transitioning Your Template
Speaker: Phil Dutson, ICON Health and Fitness

Thymeleaf is a fantastic template engine that can help you create sites faster and get code shipped. There exists however a problem, using th e template engine requires a mind-shift in how to get &quot;normal&quot; tasks accomplished. This leaves many developers in the lurch and frustrated.

In this talk I will cover the common pitfalls that developers can avoid and give examples on how to solve the common problems encountered when switching from the venerable JSTL to Thymeleaf.
