    <textOnly>Building your app management tools with Spring Boot
Speaker: Greg Turnquist
 
 Spring Boot lets you write apps better than ever. But did you ever think about writing all those support scripts and tools you inevitably need with Boot as well?

In this webinar, you will see how the Spring team has already picked up and run with Spring Boot CLI as a powerful way to manage things like all open issues against the 60+ getting started guides. See how to monitor application logs using a little Spring Integration, Spring WebSocket+STOMP, and other technologies, all with some lightweight Boot+Groovy code.

Building a Shopping Cart in 24 Hours using Spring
Speakers: Casey Doolittle and Phil Dutson
 
 Creating a transactional website that is secure, fast, and responsive is a challenge all on its own. Creating one in 24 hours borders madness, however with the resources that Spring brings to the table, this can be accomplished. Casey Doolittle and Phil Dutson were issued the task of creating a charity-benefit website two days before the sale started. In time for the opening sale, they had a simple website that was open during a set time of day, and offered users the ability to complete a purchase regardless of the device they were using.

During this talk Casey and Phil will discuss how they accomplished the feat and the techniques and tactics that were used.

Why Do I recommend Spring
Speaker: Michael Pl√∂d 
 
 Is Spring the new legacy as quite a few people tell you on their blogs? I disagree on many levels. Throughout this session I will holistically detail without any polemics why I do recommend using the Spring Framework and it&apos;s ecosystem.

Aspects that will be covered include: operational impacts, ecosystem, coding and road maps. This presentation aims at IT managers, Architects and Developers alike.
