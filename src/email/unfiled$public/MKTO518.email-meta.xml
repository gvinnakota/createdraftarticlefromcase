    <subject>Important IT Announcement - New PC/Laptop Refresh Policy and Process</subject>
    <textOnly>To all Pivotal North America and UK employees:
At Pivotal, we believe you should have the right tools to do your job. As a software development company, the technology selections we make are critical to our success and ensuring you are as productive as possible. We must also manage our technology spending levels very closely as we try to prepare Pivotal for a public offering. As such, we have developed a Pivotal-specific Laptop/PC refresh policy to better manage the equipment lifecycle and to streamline the procurement process for refresh equipment. Please review the linked policy and process document below for details. As always, if you have any questions, please open a ticket with askIT@gopivotal.com &lt;mailto:askIT@gopivotal.com&gt;.

For those of you that may receive this from EMEA (non-UK) countries or from APJ, please rest assured we are working on a streamlined process for you as well that we plan to rollout in Q2.
 
Thanks,
