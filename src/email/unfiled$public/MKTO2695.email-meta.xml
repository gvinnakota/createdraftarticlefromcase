    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Thanks for visiting Pivotal at Jenkins User Conference/CD Summit 2015. We hope you enjoyed learning about Jenkins, CI/CD and how you can deploy directly from CloudBees Jenkins to Pivotal Cloud Foundry to further streamline and automate your application delivery pipeline.

The smartest enterprises today are stretching their notion of continuous delivery to encompass operational excellence.  Increasingly, they are optimizing their continuous delivery pipelines by deploying their applications to cloud-native application platforms such as Pivotal Cloud Foundry that reduce operational concerns and enhance business agility.

In case you missed us at the conference, here’s a quick recap:


 - Karun Bakshi discussed why a cloud-native platform is critical to a CI/CD pipeline in “What Does Your Platform Do For You &lt;http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/what-does-your-platform-do-for-you-by-karun-bakshi&gt;?”
 - Jamie O’Meara showed how to deploy from CloudBees Jenkins to Pivotal Cloud Foundry in “Integrated Pipeline for Private and Public Clouds with Jenkins, CloudBees and Cloud Foundry &lt;http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/an-integrated-pipeline-for-private-and-public-clouds-with-jenkins-artifactory-and-pivotal-cloud-foundry-by-jamie-omeara&gt;”.
 - Coté and Karun Bakshi talk about the need for a cloud-native &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal-conversations/features/the-agility-frontier-continuous-delivery-and-pivotal-cloud-foundry&gt; platform in a continuous delivery context.
