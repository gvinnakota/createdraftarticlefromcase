EDITOR WELCOME
 THE PIVOTAL EXPRESS
 Steve Casale &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1033819-stephencasale&gt;, Sr. Manager, Corporate Communications
I woke up a few times this week well before dawn with a freight train running through my head - not any one thing, but bugaboos of things to be done and their consequences, real or imagined. The Pivotal express hardly recognizes the change of hour or any signal but green, but it’s one special ride, and as usual it has big things to report this week from Brussels to the Bay Area, to Austin TX. 

VMware’s launch of two open source initiatives &lt;http://bcove.me/u0jn3si1&gt; to enable cloud-native software applications – with messaging on containers &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/topics/containers&gt;, microservices &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/topics/microservices&gt;, and DevOps &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/topics/devops&gt; - is familiar Pivotal territory. Naturally, we’ve partnered with VMware here, through Lattice &lt;http://lattice.cf/&gt;. Distributed containers with Cloud Foundry &lt;https://github.com/cloudfoundry&gt; components enabling a simpler, cloud-native platform for small teams and individual developers? Check!

Data has been on a hot march. Roman Shaposhnik gives a very tidy roundup of the many fronts we’ve advanced around open source in just 60 days. Don’t miss this one. Pivotal Labs’ Alex Luttschyn introduces the first “Hot Seat” with Edward Hieatt, who steps in to field the curve balls sales teams field every day. We also get the latest gems from Pivotal Labs in Palo Alto.

And, if you haven’t yet heard it enough yet, get your customers and prospects registered for the Cloud Foundry 
Summit in May!

Enjoy.
BUSINESS UPDATE
 HELPING YOU SELL WHEN YOU&apos;RE IN THE &quot;HOT SEAT&quot;
 Alex Luttschyn &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/912507-alexluttschyn&gt;, Head of Global Sales, Pivotal Labs
Pivotal Labs &lt;https://pivotal.io/labs&gt; is incredibly important to the larger Pivotal strategy, and enterprises are jumping at the chance to work with us. With new customers in the past 90 days like Home Depot, TD Ameritrade, and double-down investments from JPMC and Under Armour, Pivotal Labs is off to a fantastic start in 2015.

But attracting more enterprise opportunities means attracting a new set of questions and 
concerns. How would do you respond to these?


 - “What is the ROI for developing in an agile or extreme programming way?”
 - “I want to be like Pivotal Labs, but I have 1,000 developers and several business leads. How do I do it?”
 - “If we use Pivotal Labs, do we have to use the rest of the Pivotal products and services?”



These are just a few of the tough questions our Field reps encounter every day. Believe it or not, there are preferable, proven responses to these and other questions. I’m happy to announce that Pivotal is launching a new series, designed to provide the Field with the answers to these common sales objections and questions.

But these aren’t your typical training videos. 

We took these questions to our leadership team, and put them in the sales “hot seat”, filming them answering the pointed customer questions. This is how the &quot;Hot Seat &lt;https://pivotal.biglms.com/the-hot-seat-series&gt;&quot; was born. I’m very excited to help launch the first video of the series, with Edward Hieatt &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/949519-edwardhieatt&gt; in the hot seat – addressing hardball questions, helping you sell Pivotal 
Labs and to position our platform business with it.

The Hot Seat videos have been chunked out as 1-2 minute digestible clips for each question and answer. We hope this becomes the most effective way to capture and share the responses you’ve all be asking for. If you’re in a Field or customer-facing role, these videos are a must-see.

Access the Hot Seat


 - Make sure you’re a registered user in the Pivotal Academy &lt;https://pivotal.biglms.com/field_enablement&gt;. You can do that on the Academy homepage under “Register.” 
 - Once registered, login to the Academy and follow the link to Edward Hieatt’s Hot Seat Series &lt;https://pivotal.biglms.com/the-hot-seat-series&gt; (You can access this video link directly, but you may need login and register for the course).
 - If prompted to register for the course to view the videos, select HSS100, which will add the Hot Seat Series course to your Dashboard for easy access.



Contact the Pivotal Academy team at academy@pivotaledu.zendesk.com &lt;mailto:academy@pivotaledu.zendesk.com&gt; with any questions or issues.

Next up: James Watters takes the Hot Seat, addressing the thornier 
questions on our open platform approach and Pivotal Cloud Foundry &lt;http://pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/pivotal-cloud-foundry&gt;. Stay tuned for that!
PRODUCT UPDATE
 OPEN AT THE SOURCE - THIS DATA JOURNEY IS FOR REAL!
 Roman Shaposhnik &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/967660-romanshaposhnik&gt;, Director of Open Source, Pivotal
It’s been a little more than eight weeks since we announced our big data blueprint &lt;https://pivotal.io/big-data/press-release/pivotal-introduces-first-open-source-enterprise-grade-big-data-product-suite&gt; and partnered with Hortonworks &lt;https://pivotal.io/big-data/press-release/pivotal-and-hortonworks-join-forces-on-apache-hadoop&gt; and the industry’s best to stand up a unique community in open source big data &lt;https://pivotal.io/big-data/press-release/technology-leaders-unite-around-open-data-platform-to-increase-enterprise-adoption-of-hadoop-and-big-data&gt;. We’re meeting enterprise demands by embracing independence and off-the-shelf reliability at scale, without sacrificing one to achieve the other.

We’ve opened up several fronts, and from the ApacheCon &lt;http://www.apachecon.com/&gt; event in Austin, to the Hadoop Summit &lt;http://2015.hadoopsummit.org/brussels/&gt; in Brussels, and from developers and engineers, to CIOs, analysts and the press, heads are nodding in approval, because we’re delivering.

Here’s a look at the first 60 days:



 - Pivotal, Hortonworks &lt;http://www.hortonworks.com&gt; and IBM &lt;http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/hadoop/enterprise.html&gt; now have our respective Hadoop-based platform products aligned on the Open Data Platform &lt;http://pivotal.io/big-data/press-release/hortonworks-ibm-pivotal-accelerate-big-data-solutions&gt; (ODP) core of Apache Hadoop 2.6 (inclusive of HDFS, YARN and MapReduce), as 
well as Apache Ambari software, for managing Hadoop environments at scale. This important first step gets the alliance’s fingers on a defined common core. The industry continues to warm &lt;http://www.techworld.com/news/big-data/open-data-platform-we-are-not-ganging-up-on-cloudera-3607778/&gt; to the move from fragmentation to unity, or as one insider put it, the only 
questions customers will be asking is, “Are you on ODP yet?”

 - Enter Geode &lt;https://pivotal.io/big-data/press-release/pivotal-releases-geode&gt;: Our first sally on the road to open source, Geode is the open source core of Pivotal GemFire &lt;https://network.pivotal.io/products/project-geode&gt;, which we’ve applied for Incubator status in the Apache Software Foundation. This is a truly unique contribution. It’s 1 million lines of code, backed by 12 years in hardened enterprise environments, where industry titans first mined the advantages of real-time data and defined atmospheric service-level requirements at scale. This is an extraordinary opportunity to bring community talent and the flexibility of open source to one of the best in-memory data tools. Geode is entering ASF at a crucial moment when the entire industry is looking for an open source in-memory data exchange layer to do to RAM – or what HDFS has done to direct attached storage. With luck and hard work, Geode could serve as a catalyst &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/big-data-pivotal/p-o-v/which-way-might-the-apache-way-take-geode?utm_source=social&amp;account_id&amp;utm_medium=TWITTER&amp;pivotal&amp;utm_campaign=OSS&amp;20150414&gt; for that solution to emerge.

 - If it’s not already clear: The Apache Software Foundation &lt;https://www.apache.org/&gt; (ASF) matters! In tandem with Geode, we’ve raised our level of sponsorship in ASF to Platinum &lt;http://pivotal.io/big-data/press-release/apache-welcomes-pivotal-as-platinum-sponsor&gt;. Rather than unload the Pivotal GemFire &lt;https://pivotal.io/big-data/pivotal-gemfire&gt; largesse into GitHub, our ASF sponsorship is a signal of our appetite to contribute much more to the open source code base, and 
supports the view that great software will rest on the shoulders of a strong, sustainable community. A community that will take Geode far beyond the use cases that we can imagine today.

Add to this the 
new dimension we opened in our Hortonworks partnership – where the Pivotal HAWQ &lt;https://pivotal.io/big-data/pivotal-hawq&gt; SQL query tool is now offered for distribution through the broad Hortonworks Data Platform &lt;http://hortonworks.com/hdp/&gt;. The agreement deepens the Apache Hadoop integration with Pivotal HAWQ, and simplifies management through new support for Apache Ambari.

Exciting is an understatement for Pivotal Big Data this past month. But the truth is, we’re just getting started. Perhaps CMS Newswire summed it up best when it said: Hey Cloudera &amp; MapR: Open Data Platform is the Real 
Deal. True, but not just the ODP, for Pivotal Big Data!
AGILE UPDATE
PALO ALTO - ETCHING DIGITAL FUTURES
 Ryan Richard &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/983856-ryanrichard&gt;, Director, Pivotal Labs Palo Alto
Pivotal Labs &lt;https://pivotal.io/labs&gt; has grown into a vibrant presence in Palo Alto. We’ve collaborated with Pivots from San Francisco, Toronto and Los Angeles on some of the biggest Pivotal Labs projects anywhere, instilling agile practices with some very different customer cultures. A few projects in particular have stood out in the past several months.

Back in the summer of 2014, Samsung spun up a brand new mobile product team, which came to Pivotal for our immersive co-innovation experience. Together we co-developed a unique social video application &lt;http://www.samsung.com/us/showcase/milk-video/&gt;, native to Samsung Android phones and tablets. With some 25 Pivots working across offices at its peak, this was one of our most complex projects.

The real story was the opportunity to partner with a fledgling Samsung team from the beginning – going from wireframes and zero code; we applied our agile methodology to get the app into the Play Store &lt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.milk.milkvideo&amp;hl=en&gt; in less than four months. This included the challenge of navigating through Samsung’s established corporate QA process in record time. Development has continued since, pushing the app in new directions. It was recently selected by Samsung to be one of the few pre-loaded apps on the new flagship Samsung Galaxy S6 at launch in the US. Though challenging at times, partnership prevailed.

Another exciting project was our collaboration with Barnes &amp; Noble on their NOOK Press &lt;https://www.nookpress.com/&gt; platform. Among other services, NOOK Press gives authors a platform to publish their manuscripts as eBooks in the NOOK ecosystem. We helped B&amp;N extend this platform to support a whole new product category by allowing authors to print high-quality books from their computers, on-demand &lt;https://print.nookpress.com/print-on-demand&gt;. They are now strategically positioned with a strong platform for the self-publishing space.

 And 
finally, I’ll also mention our work with enterprise app company Nominum &lt;http://nominum.com/&gt; on their network infrastructure product. Throughout a long and close partnership, we helped their team learn to design, develop and successfully ship an iteration of their product every quarter.

Many thanks to the whole Palo Alto Labs team, and to all of the Pivots from other offices who have worked with 
us over the past year!

With more big-name clients teed up, we’re now looking to pull Pivotal Cloud Foundry &lt;https://pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/pivotal-cloud-foundry&gt; into our client engagements. And we’re also starting to collaborate with our Pivotal colleagues in Data Engineering on select projects. Stay tuned!

PEOPLE UPDATE
 PIVOTAL DATA ENGINEERING - DATA WITH AGILITY
 Jacque Istok &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/912434-jacqueistok&gt;, Field CTO
We organized our technical Field teams this year in two key areas: Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data. This was a natural move to align the skill sets and passions of the majority of our technical Field and support teams. This formation will accelerate customer adoption and the successful implementation of our products, and also help us seed and grow their broader ecosystems.

I’m pleased to lead the data side of this effort and the new Pivotal Data Engineering (PDE) group, which 
combines our data-oriented pre-sales field engineers, Pivotal Data Labs &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/groups/109821-pivotaldatalabs&gt; engineers, and our technical customer success managers focused on data. This new group lives inside of Customer Success &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/groups/99468-customersuccessamericas&gt;, with three distinct goals for 2015:


 - Improve customer satisfaction and inclination to become a Pivotal reference customer
 - Provide the technical assistance to achieve our data bookings targets
 - Ensure more frequent and consistent customer interactions on both paid and non-paid engagements



Further, we’re giving these new technical Field teams latitude to operate more autonomously. We’re adopting agile practices whenever possible and implementing regional “data pods” or small teams of data practitioners with deep domain expertise. Teams are empowered to act swiftly and drive a broad definition of growth by expanding our skill sets, making strategic hires and expanding our delivery capabilities through partnerships.

We’re about 50-people strong, led by Tim Coventry-Cox &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/913325-timcoventrycox&gt; and Kevin Muerle &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/912452-kevinmuerle&gt; in the East and West (Americas theater) respectively, 
focused mainly on pre-sales and select post-sales delivery packages like solutions assurance &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/file/d/0B00kpGAXc0AbaE5XM3dtNlNlaDg/edit&gt; and onboarding. In a parallel effort, we’ve established a Technical Account Management (TAM) &lt;https://drive.google.com/drive/#folders/0B-ohgFENqcsXUEI5bzlwVkxJY2s/0B4tN6bZGhZYNc2g1SGhQTFNQNGM&gt; program in the East and West – led by Scott Day &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1038370-scottday&gt; and Keith Martin &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1076797-keithmartin&gt; – to be the overall 
voice of the customer. This team will help grow our subscription base, ensure consistent renewals and successful deployments, and handle escalations.

From top to bottom, we’re emphasizing an agile, practitioner-led team. You may find me, or John Schnitzel &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/947519-johnschnitzel&gt;, out in the Field – helping define new packages (like Advisory Services), expansions or upgrades. If you see us, the new “PDE Pivots,” feel free to ask what we’re up to. We’re always willing to talk about the latest customer deployment of Pivotal Big Data Suite &lt;https://pivotal.io/big-data/pivotal-big-data-suite&gt;, and we’ll be sure to keep you posted!
