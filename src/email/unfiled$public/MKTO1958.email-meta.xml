    <subject>Event Wrap Up: A New Approach to Big Data</subject>
    <textOnly>DEFINING DATA IN THE CLOUD ERA
A Pivotal Strategy Update
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

What an exciting day at Pivotal! This event showcased our groundbreaking new approach, including the launch of Big Data 
Suite 2.0, and new open source strategies which will remove traditional barriers to innovation. 

We also shared exciting news about the Open Data Platform, an association of industry leaders focused on the advancement of Hadoop for the enterprise, as well as Pivotalâ€™s partnership with 
Hortonworks. 

The on-demand replay and other event materials are now available &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/new-approach-to-big-data&gt; 
for you to watch and share. We also invite you to come see Pivotal in action at a Pivotal Big Data Roadshow &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/big-data/data-roadshow&gt; near you.

Thanks,
The Pivotal Team</textOnly>
