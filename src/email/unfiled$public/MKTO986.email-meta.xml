    <subject>Bay Area Survey Results and Building a Great Place to Work</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi Team, 
 

Back in February I wrote how we should strive to make Pivotal not only the best place to work in tech, but the best place to work anywhere. We took a first step when we encouraged all Bay Area teams to participate in the Q1 San Francisco Business Times Best Places to Work &lt;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/gallery/15121&gt; survey. Our main goal with that opportunity was to have you weigh in on the company’s evolution, and how you feel about our culture and environment. All of this will help us learn and improve.

Approximately 55% of you participated in the survey, and while it would have been a big achievement for such a new company to make the list, the results affirmed that Pivotal is a unique company with a lot to offer, and one with areas that can be improved. The survey feedback is already allowing us to learn about and focus on areas important to you and to creating a great workplace.

In short, it was a good start.

Pivotal is a complex company, and we recognize that expectations and experiences vary. My team is committed to using this feedback as an important starting point for creating a consistently great work experience for everyone.

What Works and What To Improve

Click here &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/presentation/d/19d_xvAjZbcR8SSOP8qk9odtKQFJ0TMh84vC1oAuf8UE/edit#slide=id.p18&gt; for a summary of our findings, with key actions we have initiated as a result. My team will also follow with “brown bag” sessions in the Bay Area to give more details on the initiatives and our goals, so be on the lookout for dates and times.

In general, survey participants (all of you):


 - Are very positive on Pivotal’s vision and goals;
 - Enjoy your work, your teams, and your contributions to both;
 - Appreciate the perks that Pivotal offers.



Areas that were high on your list for improvements included:


 - A desire to feel more connected across Pivotal, and to see how your contributions impact the overall business;
 - Improving our systems and tools;
 - Making benefits more competitive.



Forward

We’ll continue to use your feedback to inform our People initiatives. In early September, we’ll conduct the first of our own surveys that will be brief, pointed and high impact (no more 100-question company surveys). More details to come.

Please continue to provide your input. It is an essential part of making Pivotal an outstanding place to work. Stay tuned, and thank you!
