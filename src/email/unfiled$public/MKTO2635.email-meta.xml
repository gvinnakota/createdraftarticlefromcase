    <subject>Labs Global Expansion</subject>
    <textOnly>All,

It’s been an amazing first half of 2015 at Labs. We’re seeing huge demand for our services from an impressive group of customers. More than ever, companies recognize the value in the way we work and how it can help them become far more effective in their product development operations. They also understand that Cloud Foundry is the platform that they need to enable the way we work at Labs: the Labs + CF story is working. This integrated offering is leading clients to ask for our help in a full-scale transformation into a modern software company by emulating Pivotal’s culture and process.

At this midpoint of the 
year, I’d like to thank all of you for the work you do every day. It’s because of you that we continue to be successful and help so many customers.

Accelerating our international expansion
Because of the increased demand for Labs services we’ve decided to accelerate our expansion plans. This includes expanding faster in EMEA (Europe, Middle-East and Africa) and APJ (Asia Pacific and Japan). In Europe, we’re going to open new Labs offices this year in Dublin and Berlin, and in APJ we’re going to open in Tokyo and Sydney.

As you know, replicating our culture is key to the 
success of each office, and as we add new offices overseas it’s important that we have an overall leader who has deep experience with the Labs culture and business. I’m thrilled to announce that Josh Knowles has agreed to move to London to lead the Labs expansion in EMEA. He will partner with Alan Coad on building out Pivotal in the region. This change takes effect July 1, although we expect it will take a few months to transition out of his current role.

Josh leaves big shoes to fill after five years on the East Coast. I’m happy to say that Rahul Singh has agreed to take on the leadership of the New York, DC and Boston offices in addition to his current responsibilities in Toronto. Congratulations, Josh and Rahul!

Establishing a transformation team
Client interest in 
undergoing cultural and technical transformation has been so great that we have decided to create a team responsible for defining and leading Pivotal’s Transformation offering, reporting into me. Today the notion of Transformation means many things to different clients, and having a team responsible for centralizing the vision will help us be successful with these important engagements. This team will be the point of contact for the sales team to work with and continually hone our offering. The team will help the sales field vet and navigate potential Transformation clients, tee up engagements for success, and shepherd clients through the long-term experience we can offer as a company.

I’m pleased to announce that Siobhán McFeeney will be joining us in July as VP Transformation to lead the team. Siobhán knows us well from being a Labs startup client a few years ago in the San Francisco office. She was most recently the Chief Operating Officer and briefly interim co-CEO of AAA Northern California, Nevada and Utah, and was recognized as one of the “Most Influential Bay Area Women in Business” in the San Francisco Business Times. We’re thrilled to have her on board.

Janice and Jason Fraser will join the Transformation team in expanded roles. In addition to  continuing to run the Innovation practice they will help to define and drive our Transformation strategy.

Thanks for being part of Labs at this exciting time. As always, feel free to reach out to me or your local management team if you have any questions.
