    <textOnly>Hi All,

Some important changes have been made by the EMC IT team to make network access more reliable for Pivots working from EMC offices worldwide.  While these changes will be transparent to most people, we like to keep you informed, as some Pivots may notice the changes.

If you do not work from 
an EMC office location, then you can stop reading now.

However, if your primary office is at an EMC office location, or you frequently travel to an EMC office, then please review the information 
below.

The table below summarizes how you may be impacted and what you need to do.
 
For Pivotal Wi-Fi users, your experience will remain unchanged (with the exception of the occasional warning page in your browser before you continue to a few web sites).

For Pivots working from EMC offices that are connected to the wired network, you are probably using zScaler today to access common Pivotal apps like Google Drive.  The zScaler service has been replaced with a native service running on the EMC network (called ScanSafe).  To continue accessing Pivotal apps like Google Drive from the EMC network, a simple configuration change is needed on your machine, and weâ€™re here to help!

If you run into any issues 
or have any questions, please don&apos;t hesitate to email ask@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:ask@pivotal.io&gt; so we can give you a hand.

Thanks,
Brian Murray and Ryan Van Aken</textOnly>
