    <textOnly>Moving to StackOverflow for Community Interaction
Dear Spring community and Forum users -

We are deeply grateful for all the interaction on our community forums, and wish to thank you for all the questions, answers, and discussions.

A better community experience awaits all us at  - where many of us are interacting already. As part of our ongoing effort here at Pivotal to provide you with the best possible community experience, the forum.spring.io website is retiring today, 6/20/2014. &lt;stackoverflow.com&gt;

 &lt;stackoverflow.com&gt;

Users seeking community support should use the corresponding tag on StackOverflow.com. You can see a list of the StackOverflow tags that our engineers (and the community) monitor at  &lt;stackoverflow.com&gt;http://spring.io/questions &lt;http://spring.io/questions&gt;. If you are unsure about which StackOverflow tag maps to a particular topic here on , please visit the  &lt;stackoverflow.com&gt;blog post &lt;http://spring.io/blog/2014/06/18/retiring-the-forum-spring-io-website&gt; detailing the shutdown plans where there is a mapping.

We look forward to interacting with you there!</textOnly>
