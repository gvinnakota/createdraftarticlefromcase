FEATURED SESSION with JUERGEN HOELLER

 Caching and Messaging Improvements in Spring Framework 4.1 &lt;https://2014.event.springone2gx.com/schedule/sessions/caching_and_messaging_improvements_in_spring_framework_4_1.html&gt;
 This session showcases major new features along the lines of two key themes in 
Spring Framework 4.1: We’ll start with numerous improvements around the caching abstraction, as requested by the community, including the support for JCache (JSR-107) standard annotations. We’ll then move on to messaging-related features such as annotated JMS listener endpoints with flexible method signatures, using the messaging abstraction introduced in Spring Framework 4.0 and therefore aligning our core JMS support with our STOMP endpoint style. 

Huge Discount on Immersion Training at the show!

If you select a registration package that includes the $200 two-day Immersion 
Training, you will be contacted to select one of the three options. You must attend only one of the Immersion Trainings for September 7-8, 2014. Day 2 training on September 8, 2014 will end before the official start of activities for SpringOne 2GX 2014.
