    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Thank you for registering for the upcoming Pivotal Cloud Platform Roadshow in India on Thursday, December 4, 2014. Unfortunately, we are over capacity and cannot honor all registrations for that day. Due to the high demand for this workshop, we are hosting another event the day prior, Wednesday, December 3, 2014. The same agenda and content will be presented and the workshop will still be held at EMC 
Headquarters. 

If you would like to join us on Wednesday, December 3, we ask that you confirm your attendance &lt;http://connect.pivotal.io/PCF-Roadshow-India-12-3.html&gt;. 

Please RSVP for Wednesday, December 3 &lt;http://connect.pivotal.io/PCF-Roadshow-India-12-3.html&gt;, print your confirmation email and present upon your arrival to the event. 

Should you fail to confirm your registration, we will not allow 
entry into the event.


Thank you for your understanding and apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.
