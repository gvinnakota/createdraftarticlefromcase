    <subject>Pivotal Acquires Quickstep Technologies</subject>
    <textOnly>Team,

I’m excited to announce that we have just completed the acquisition of Quickstep Technologies. Founded by an elite team of database systems experts from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and led by Professor Jignesh Patel, Quickstep has developed a next-generation query processing technology that is without precedent in the world of databases. 

Quickstep brings a smart, agile software capability that accelerates data processing. Its technology will be integrated into Pivotal HAWQ and the Pivotal Greenplum Database, and is expected to improve SQL query execution performance across the Pivotal Big Data Suite. We’re delighted to welcome Jignesh and members of the Quickstep team to the Pivotal family. Over the coming weeks, we’ll be integrating Jignesh and his team into Pivotal.

Read more about today’s announcement below and please join me in welcoming Quickstep to Pivotal!
