If you&apos;re planning to attend, be sure to visit us at booth #721 and get your most challenging questions answered by Pivotal experts. Meet members of our data science team and see Pivotal Big Data Suite &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/big-data/pivotal-big-data-suite&gt; in action. 

While you are in town for Strata, we would like to 
invite you to our San Francisco office for an exclusive in-person strategy update on Tuesday, February 17th. Lunch will be provided and you will have an opportunity to tour our Pivotal office and see agile development in action. We hope you can be there for the groundbreaking data event! RSVP &gt;&gt;
