    <subject>Announcing Q4 Pivotal and Isilon Incentives</subject>
    <textOnly>Team:

As we enter Q4, I’m pleased to share good news on our Federation sponsor EMC that creates better opportunities for us to drive sales together.

Yesterday, EMC/Isilon announced to their field organization that Isilon Account Executives and Field Engineers will 
receive quota relief and commission credit for the EMC Data Computing Appliance (DCA) during Q4 of 2014. Isilon had not previously compensated its sales teams on the DCA. With this announcement, Isilon is now positively incentivized to drive Pivotal data products into their accounts via the DCA.

We’re equally excited to announce that through Q4 2014, Pivotal will sponsor a sales incentive program with Isilon’s field organization for 
our software products. Under the program, Isilon account executives and field engineers will be eligible for a $5,000 sales incentive bonus for selling or assisting in standalone software sales of the Pivotal Hadoop distribution with HAWQ, and Pivotal’s Big Data Suite. Details on the program can be found in the FAQ on the Inside Pivotal Alliance home page &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/afpg/home&gt;. 

These new incentives and alignment with Isilon will help us win the all-important HDFS workload that is increasingly important to EMC. 

Now is the time for the EMC and Pivotal field to partner and win our deserved share of the Big Data market. As you build your Q4 plan, we ask that you reach out to your Isilon counterparts in Q4 to support these joint sales efforts.  

Should you have specific questions on this program please contact Laurie Pino &lt;mailto:lpino@pivitoal.io&gt; or Nick Cayou &lt;mailto:ncayou@pivotal.io&gt;. Thanks for your support. 

Let’s use this partnership to help us finish big in Q4!
