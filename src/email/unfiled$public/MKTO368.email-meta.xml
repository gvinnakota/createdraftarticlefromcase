    <textOnly>Hi Team, 

 
I am pleased to announce the launch of Start Me Up, &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/startmeup/&gt; our new dedicated webtool to assist with New Hire onboarding.
The onboarding and candidate experience is a strategic priority for Pivotal and provides the opportunity for us to quickly assimilate new joiners into our company in an exciting way. We must all collectively ensure that the experience of all new joiners is world class and reflects our culture and values.
Enabling Pivotal employees with the proper tools and knowledge upon joining is paramount to a successful starting experience. Start Me Up &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/startmeup/&gt; centralizes all of the tools and actions new hires are required to complete during their first several weeks as an employee at Pivotal.
Managers play a very important role in the onboarding experience. To that end, we have created a Manager section in Start Me Up &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/startmeup/&gt; that provides guidelines, resources, checklists and timeframes to help support you and enable your new talent to hit the ground running.
Please spend a few moments to explore the site &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/startmeup/home&gt;. 
As you bring new hires on board we ask that you leverage this tool and encourage your new hires to do so as well.  All new hires will also be introduced to this site and itâ€™s functionality at new hire orientation each Monday.
We are confident that this will help reinforce a positive new joining experience and our overall commitment to developing high performing talent within our company.
Should you have any questions, feedback or suggestions, please reach out to Lauren Tropeano &lt;mailto:ltropeano@gopivotal.com&gt; or Victoria Payne &lt;mailto:vpayne@gopivotal.com&gt;.
Regards,



Joe
