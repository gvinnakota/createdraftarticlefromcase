    <textOnly>Global Field Operations Team,
It has been a busy and exciting few weeks in Field Operations! The inaugural WWSKO event introduced our new business strategy. We left with a clear focus to pursue Enterprise opportunities with the Big Data Suite and Pivotal CF – positioning us to become a world-class software company. Aligning with that messaging, we shared the new bookings policy, forecasting process, deal desk/review procdedure, Federation engagement, and FY14 compensation plan. The feedback has been great thus far, and we appreciate your participation and input. 
All of this content, along with the FAQs and presentation recording, is now available on our NEW Field Operations Inside Pivotal Page &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/inside-pivotal/departments/global_field-operations&gt;. 
Please bookmark the page for your reference. It is designed to be your one-stop resource for all sales materials and documentation – making it easier and faster than ever to find what you are looking for. Additionally, we’ve added a Socialcast feed to the bottom of the page to help enable you to stay up-to-date on the latest Field initiatives. 
Good selling and let&apos;s close Q1 strong!
