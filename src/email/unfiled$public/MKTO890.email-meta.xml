    <subject>What’s Next for Pivotal Palo Alto</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi Team,

Pivotal is dedicated to providing world-class facilities for our people, and we often receive comments on our great office settings. I’m pleased to announce what’s next for Palo Alto, including new collaborative arrangements in our open work areas, welcoming a new tenant to Deer Creek, and new amenities.

We’ll be reconfiguring some of our open work areas to bring more of the kinetic energy and 
opportunities for close collaboration that Pivotal offices are known for. Further, and in consultation with Facilities and Palo Alto team leaders, we’ll be adding new amenities for you.

Work is expected to start in early July and through August, and will occur over several weekends, largely outside of office work hours, so please continue to work at 
your stations as you normally would. If there is any impact to you or your team spaces, you will be notified in due course, and again we do not anticipate any interruptions to your activities. 

Welcome BNY Mellon

As part of this, we’ve made the decision to lease the vacant space on the 2nd floor to a new business unit from BNY Mellon. This is a real opportunity to partner with a customer whose most innovative work dovetails with what we do best. BNY Mellon will bring its new “BNYM Innovation Lab” business unit and its development intensive work to our Silicon Valley office to develop offerings for the financial industry. They are keen to have proximity to our Pivots, and both BNYM and Pivotal see this as an opportunity to grow our relationship. This also allows us to defray the expenses we have for an entire facility by covering the occupied space in a smarter way.

BNYM will start with a small team and will grow into the space over time, on which construction will begin in August to separate it from our space. Under the sublease, BNYM will share the common area space on the 1st floor such as the cafe, patio area, Tesla training room, and the Customer Briefing Center, as well as parking and the Game areas. The Facilities team have created an FAQ with details &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/document/d/1BYK98L86OeglRZsT3ftF2I9FVjRICNwieozl3bw1wIs/edit?usp=sharing&gt; on both the new configuration and sublease 
arrangements.

New Amenities

Importantly, the expenses we cover through this arrangement will help us add new amenities faster. We’re proceeding with a handful of popular options that we’ve drawn up as a result of our consultation with Facilities and managers. This will include adding three new showers, a workout room, new patio furniture, and a new BBQ (which was recently installed). 

We want the workplace to continue to be an important draw for you, and one which deepens our imprint in the heart of Silicon Valley. The new configuration and new amenities are steps in that direction, and we are planning for more. Stay tuned. 

Finally, please help me welcome the BNYM team to Deer Creek. Facilities will send out any additional communications prior to construction activities, and please reach out to Lisa Davern ldavern@gopivotal.com &lt;mailto:ldavern@gopivotal.com&gt; with any 
questions.</textOnly>
