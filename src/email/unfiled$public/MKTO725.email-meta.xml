    <subject>Thank you Adrian Colyer</subject>
    <textOnly>Team:
It is with deep appreciation that we acknowledge today as Adrian Colyer&apos;s last day at Pivotal.
Adrian has been an instrumental part of the senior leadership team at Pivotal since Day 1 . . . and candidly well before April 1st, 2013. It was during the Spring of 2012, when Paul first asked Adrian and myself to collaborate on a thesis for combining assets across both VMWare and EMC into a new venture. And for the past 2+ years, I have had the privilege of working alongside Adrian, witnessing firsthand his many talents, and seeing him always put the best interests of the company first. 
Whether it was the early ideation of the &quot;Pivotal Initiative&quot;, helping to define an ambitious new technology agenda for Spring, supporting the company-wide efforts around Pivotal CF/One in 2013, or his leadership and diplomacy skills in the formation of the Cloud Foundry Foundation, it&apos;s safe to say that Adrian has influenced nearly every important aspect of our company.
Adrian has decided to step down from his day-to-day duties at Pivotal, take some much deserved time off, and get back to working with early-stage companies and technologies. He has agreed to serve as an advisor and consultant to Pivotal starting July 1st, so we will have the good fortune of continuing to benefit from his wisdom and counsel.
On behalf of the leadership team, please join me in thanking Adrian for his many contributions, and wishing him the best for the future.
Adrian&apos;s personal email is adrian@aspectprogrammer.org &lt;mailto:adrian@aspectprogrammer.org&gt; if you&apos;d like to stay in touch.
Regards,
