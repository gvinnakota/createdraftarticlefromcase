    <subject>9/14 Analytical Innovation: How to Build the Next Generation Data Platform</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 
There was a time when the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) was the only way to provide a 360-degree analytical view of the business. In recent years many organizations have deployed disparate analytics alternatives to the EDW, including: cloud data warehouses, machine learning frameworks, graph databases, geospatial tools, and other technologies. Often these new deployments have resulted in the creation of analytical silos that are too complex to integrate, limiting global insights and innovation.
