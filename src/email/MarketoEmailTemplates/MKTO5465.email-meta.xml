Greetings,
In the spirit of the holiday season, SpringOne Platform is hosting a Toys For Tots &lt;[[https://www.toysfortots.org/]]&gt; drive. Our mission is to collect new, unwrapped toys, throughout the duration of the conference, for distribution to children in the San Francisco Bay Area community during the holidays. 

 Please consider bringing a toy with you to SpringOne Platform &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/]]&gt;. There will be a toy drop off area in the Moscone West 1st Floor lobby Monday-Thursday. 

 If you have any questions about what toys to bring, or about the Toys For Tots Foundation, please visit their official website here &lt;[[https://www.toysfortots.org/]]&gt;. 

 From all of us at SpringOne Platform, we thank you in advance! 

 The SpringOne Platform Team</textOnly>
