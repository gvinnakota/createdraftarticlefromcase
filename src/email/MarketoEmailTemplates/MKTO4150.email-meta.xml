    <textOnly>Pivotal is pleased to be hosting you in San Francisco on September 19-20 for the Transformation Council Meeting and Workshop led by Eric Ries, author of The Lean Startup and The Leader’s Guide.     

We will kick off the event with a private dinner on Monday evening at Perbacco, followed by a half day of transformation talks and a workshop on Tuesday morning.
