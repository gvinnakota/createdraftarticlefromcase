    <subject>Learn how Liberty Mutual accelerated speed to market with Pivotal</subject>
    <textOnly>&quot;One of the things we&apos;ve learned is that if you can&apos;t get it to market more quickly, there is no doubt that the market will have changed and no matter how well you&apos;ve engineered it or built it or deployed it or trained your folks, it&apos;s not going to be quite right because it&apos;s just a little too late.&quot;

—James McGlennon
Executive VP and CIO, Liberty Mutual
