    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

I am a product manager working on Pivotal Web Services (PWS) and I am writing because in the past you upgraded to use the full capabilities of PWS but later discontinued using the service. In an effort to make PWS better, I have one quick question.

What made you discontinue using Pivotal Web Services?

Thank you for your time.

Best Regards,

Charles Wu
