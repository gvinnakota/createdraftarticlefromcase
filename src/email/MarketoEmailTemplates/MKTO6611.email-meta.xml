    <subject>Pivotal Breakfast Invite: Innovating in a Software-Driven World</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

To keep pace with competition and drive innovation, organisations are increasingly learning to become software-driven companies. While many support the business objectives of driving innovation and being agile, organisations often struggle to attain the practices, processes and technologies to support this transformation.

I thought you might be interested in joining Pivotal for an executive breakfast with your industry peers as we discuss:
- Lessons learned at the cutting edge of software development in Australia
- How to implement long-term transformation within your organisation
- Australia insights from the Build To Adapt Framework Report, an industry survey created in partnership with Longitude Research and Ovum

Upcoming Event:
Melbourne - 25th Oct - 8am - White Lane - REGISTER: https://connect.pivotal.io/au_benchmark_breakfasts_1018.html

Featured Speakers:Â James Bligh, Co-Founder, RedCrew (former Senior Manager Commercial Feasibility at National Australia Bank) and Roz Gregory, Director Customer Success &amp; Digital Transformation, APJ, Pivotal

We look forward to seeing you there.

Regards,

Lionel Lim
Vice President and Managing Director, Asia Pacific &amp; Japan
