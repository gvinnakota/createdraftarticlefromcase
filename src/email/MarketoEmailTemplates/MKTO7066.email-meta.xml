    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 
 
 We hope you enjoyed Perform 2019 as much as we did. If there’s one thing we learned, it’s that AI and automation are paving the way for more innovation in enterprises.

The integrations &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/platform/services-marketplace/monitoring-metrics-and-logging/dynatrace?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=global-event-dynatrace-perform-las-vegas-q119]]&gt; between Dynatrace and Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) help customers like Humana and Kroger deploy applications quickly, scale resources on demand, and alleviate the “undifferentiated heavy lifting” of individually instrumenting monitoring for every application. Check out this podcast &lt;[[https://www.spreaker.com/user/perfbytes/speaker-jimmystewart-kroger]]&gt; to learn more.

More companies don&apos;t need to build or use bespoke systems for the flexibility of running their applications on premise and in the public cloud. To learn more about how you can use Dynatrace and PCF together, watch our Journey to Cloud-native series beginning with Where to Start in Your App Modernization Process &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/dynatrace/journey-to-cloud-native-where-to-start-in-your-app-modernization-process?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=global-event-dynatrace-perform-las-vegas-q119]]&gt;.

Thank you,
