    <subject>Thanks for your interest in RabbitMQ and Pivotal!</subject>
    <textOnly>Communications, such as the capabilities provided by a message broker, are an important consideration in building modern, event-driven and microservices architectures. This is true whether you are building new applications, or modernizing your legacy applications by decomposing them into smaller modules.
 
RabbitMQ is the most widely used open source, messaging technology in the market.
 
According to Ovum, &quot;Pivotal is well positioned to offer a comprehensive platform for microservices, cloud-native and event-driven applications&quot;, and RabbitMQ is one of the key components in achieving that.
