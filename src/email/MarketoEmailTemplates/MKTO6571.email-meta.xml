    <subject>REGISTRATION UPDATE: Cocktail Reception at CF Summit Basel on October 9th!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Thank you to those who attended our recent PCF User Group Meetings! To help us plan for future meetings, if you attended the September 17th EMEA virtual user group call please take two minutes to complete a follow-up survey here &lt;[[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/X36WQ3T]]&gt; and for those that attended our September 
24th in-person meeting at SpringOne Platform please fill out this survey &lt;[[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CXPN3W7]]&gt;.


Following a successful EMEA user group launch you’re invited to a cocktail reception on October 9 in Basel, Switzerland before Cloud Foundry Summit kicks off. Please note this date has changed from October 8th to the 9th to accommodate those coming in later for CF Summit. Registration can be found here &lt;[[https://connect.pivotal.io/PCF-Users-Group-Cocktail-Reception.html]]&gt;.

For new members, stay up-to-date on upcoming PCF user group meetings by signing up for our slack channel &lt;[[http://slack.cloudfoundry.org/]]&gt;. Once you’re on, ping Madison Schlegel, so she knows your handle and can add you to the group. You can also add your colleagues directly to the private channel once you’re in.
Looking forward to seeing you at these upcoming meetings!


Your host,
