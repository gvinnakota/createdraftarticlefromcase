    <textOnly>Team,

Thank you all for joining us at the Town Hall this past Thursday. Catch the replay here &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/pivotal-town-hall?utm_source=iphome&amp;utm_medium=slider&amp;utm_campaign=townhall]]&gt;, and please take a few moments to take the Town Hall survey &lt;[[https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/forms/d/1RZjdMCNjXZCTX-jC68yeZJGjL8Buc24esWQkchrrSR8/viewform]]&gt;. Your feedback is valuable, and helps us improve these events.

Weâ€™re working hard to wrap up an outstanding year, and as I mentioned, we still have some big notes to hit before we close out 2015.

Thank you all for the commitment and hard work, and have a happy and peaceful holidays!</textOnly>
