The ability to deliver software has now become a critical requirement for survival in today’s business world.
 
 Companies need to build better software faster to compete. Can your development team move from an idea to production in one motion—in a matter of weeks or days?
 
 Existing monolithic applications, legacy platforms and lengthy operational deployment cycles are holding innovation back. Learn how companies are removing the innovation barrier by moving to a cloud-native approach for the software delivery lifecycle.
 
 Join us &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/event/migrating-to-microservices-workshop?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=sg-workshop-q116]]&gt; for a two-day workshop and learn how companies are deploying software in weeks vs. months using a cloud-native platform.

 - Start with a monolith application and migrate it step-by-step to microservices following cloud-native best practices
