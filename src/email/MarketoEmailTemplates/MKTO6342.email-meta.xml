    <subject>8/15 Webinar: Enhance Application Security with Automated, Open-Source Security Management</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar Enhance Application Security with Automated, Open-Source Security Management &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/aug-15-enhance-application-security-with-automated-open-source-security-management-webinar?utm_source=promo&amp;utm_medium=webinar&amp;utm_campaign=backduck-pcf&amp;utm_term=q318]]&gt;, on 
August 15, 2018. 

Almost every major company uses or builds software containing open-source components today—96% of them, according to a report from Black Duck by Synopsis. The same report revealed that 78% of the apps that were audited had at least one vulnerability, including several that were reported nearly six years ago! Needless to say, not having solid open-source use policies and procedures in place for your developers poses a significant risk to any enterprise. 

Black Duck and Pivotal collaborated to deliver a secure and simple user experience for rapidly building and deploying applications so that developers can benefit from the many advantages of using open source in their apps with confidence. Join Dave Meurer from Black Duck and Kamala Dasika from Pivotal as they discuss:


	- 
Key security concepts you need to know pertaining to cloud-native application development

	- 
How to simplify and automate open-source security management for your applications and reduce license, operational risk, 
or policy violations 



Presenters: 
Dave Meurer, Alliances Technical Manager, Synopsys
Kamala Dasika, GTM for Pivotal 
Cloud Foundry Technology Partners, Pivotal
