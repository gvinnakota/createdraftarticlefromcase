Hi there,
 
 Why did we hear so much about “Digital Transformation” in 2016, and frankly what does it mean? While it&apos;s easy to dismiss the phrase with an eye-roll, there&apos;s no better phrase to represent improving how IT is used to help drive business innovation...and the huge changes organizations must go through to be successful.
 
This webinar, with Nick Patience, Research Vice President for 451 Research&apos;s software team, and Michael Coté of Pivotal, focuses on a pragmatic definition and approach to Digital Transformation as seen through the experiences of organizations who&apos;ve lived through it. The webinar discussion includes:

 - Why now is the time for Digital Transformation 
 - How the balance of power between customer and provider contributes to this new revolution 
 - Shifting priorities that require new practices and processes and the technical tools and platforms that support them 
 - Real-world examples of organizations that have been there (we’ll share all the gorey details, including what worked and didn&apos;t work for them) 

We hope you enjoy this recorded webinar:
