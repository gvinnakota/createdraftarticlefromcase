    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


We invite you to read the newly published Forrester study: The Total Economic Impact™ of Pivotal Cloud Foundry &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/analyst-reports/the-total-economic-impact-of-pivotal-cloud-foundry?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=TEI-q417]]&gt;.


To better understand the benefits, costs, and risks associated with Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF), Forrester interviewed several companies with multiple years of experience using PCF. Prior to using PCF, these companies struggled with long and expensive release cycles, complex infrastructure operations, and a host of other challenges related to developer, operations, and customer satisfaction. These issues led these organizations to look for a platform to help speed up and modernize their application delivery methods.


Discover how companies are transforming the role of IT to support their business initiatives with PCF- all while seeing an ROI of 135%.
