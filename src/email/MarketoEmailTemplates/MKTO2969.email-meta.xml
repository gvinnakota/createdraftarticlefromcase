The New Digital Economy - Ireland
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
 
 With all the noise surrounding digital disruption, it&apos;s difficult to separate hype from reality. Do you understand how to gain or retain market leadership in the new era of digital disruption? How will you drive customer acquisition and retention with superior digital experiences? How will you accelerate the pace of business innovation to stay ahead of your competitors?
 
 
If these are some of the challenges you face, join us to learn how digital disruption is affecting businesses in Ireland, why digital disruptors are successful and what modern technology capabilities you need to become a leading digital business.
 
 Hear from our 
expert line-up of Pivotal and industry speakers. We&apos;ll also be joined during the morning by An Taoiseach, Enda Kenny TD for a special announcement and to learn about about the leading role Ireland is playing in the world digital economy.
 
 Space is limited!
 
We look forward to seeing 
you!
