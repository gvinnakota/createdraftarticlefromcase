    <subject>What happens when your MuleFlow app goes down?</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi there,

If there’s one thing we learned at MuleSoft CONNECT 2017, it’s that integration today is more complex than ever. MuleSoft customers *love* how Anypoint lets them integrate SaaS and on premise systems. They want to govern and manage their APIs. And they know how important it is to promote the reuse of their apps and services. But, your MuleFlow apps still need care and feeding to stay available, scale as needed, and remain secure.  And you put a lot of effort into doing just that. Ask yourself -  Is all that effort differentiating your business?
The new integrations between MuleSoft Anypoint and Pivotal Cloud Foundry are already helping customers like Liberty Mutual unburden themselves from the “undifferentiated heavy lifting” of patching, securing, and managing the health of applications, including MuleFlow applications. Check out how they are reliably going from code commit to production in just 10 minutes &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/liberty-mutual?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=global-event-mulesoft]]&gt;!
More companies are finding that they don&apos;t need to build bespoke systems to develop and run their applications.

Thank you,
