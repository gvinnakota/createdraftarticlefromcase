    <subject>This Month in Spring</subject>
    <textOnly>August 2018
Hi, Spring fans! How&apos;re things? I hope you&apos;re keeping healthy and happy and enjoying the summer (or winter, in the Southern Hemisphere) in whatever part of the world you&apos;re in right now. It&apos;s August already! We&apos;re eight months into the year, and I&apos;m still not done with my to-dos from February! Oi. The world&apos;s been a little crazy since last we spoke. Let&apos;s see.

Google&apos;s Ray Tsang &lt;[[https://twitter.com/saturnism]]&gt; and I delivered a packed talk at Google Next &apos;18 on Spring Cloud GCP and the newly re-architected Project Riff &lt;[[https://projectriff.io/]]&gt; function-as-a-service (now based on KNative, which Google and Pivotal announced this week).
 
I delivered an online training Monday, Bootiful Kotlin, that looks at using Kotlin with Spring. If you&apos;re interested, by the way, I&apos;m delivering an encore to the packed Reactive Spring online training on August 2 &lt;[[https://www.safaribooksonline.com/live-training/courses/reactive-spring-boot/0636920198048/]]&gt;—this Thursday!


I spoke with customers and at conferences hither and yon. We also had the epic Spring Days Los Angeles events, R&amp;D meetings in Boston, MA, and the legendary OSCON conference in in Portland, OR. And coming up quickly, our annual conference, SpringOne Platform &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/?utm_source=spring-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=spring-newsletter-august-2018]]&gt;. Use code S1P200_JLong &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/?utm_source=spring-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=spring-newsletter-august-2018]]&gt; to get $200 off the cost of your SpringOne Platform conference pass. I hope to see you there.








The Long and short of it &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/josh-blog/this-month-in-spring-july-31st-2018?utm_source=spring-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=spring-newsletter-august-2018]]&gt;

SpringOne Tour Keeps on Trucking


The SpringOne Tour bus has a hankering for bratwurst and has thus set its GPS to Chicago &lt;[[https://springonetour.io/2018/chicago?utm_source=spring-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=spring-newsletter-august-2018]]&gt;, for an event taking place August 28–29. If you can’t make these stops but still want an amuse-bouche before the main event &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/?utm_source=spring-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=spring-newsletter-august-2018]]&gt; this September in Washington, D.C., visit our tour page &lt;[[https://springonetour.io/?utm_source=spring-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=spring-newsletter-august-2018]]&gt; for more dates.







Put me in the front row &lt;[[https://2018.event.springonetour.io/register?utm_source=spring-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=spring-newsletter-august-2018]]&gt;






































Register for S1P


Oh, shoot! Looks like the last SpringOne Platform &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/?utm_source=spring-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=spring-newsletter-august-2018]]&gt; price cliff just came and went, as cliffs typically do. However, we still want you to get the best price possible and attend the largest Spring event of the year, so we thought about it, and cliffs be damned, we decided to extend the offer to you!


Use code S1P200_JLong to get $200 off the cost of your SpringOne Platform conference pass.
