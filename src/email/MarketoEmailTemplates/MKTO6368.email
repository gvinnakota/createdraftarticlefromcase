<p><span style="font-family: 'Proxima-Nova',sans-serif;">Hi&nbsp;{{lead.First Name:default=there}}, <br><br>It's August already and <a href="https://springoneplatform.io/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=s1p&amp;utm_campaign=springone&amp;utm_term=q318" target="_blank" id="" style="color: #00ae9e; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 400;">SpringOne Platform 2018</a> is just&nbsp;about a month away! The conference has something for everyone. Listen to contributors talking about what's new in the Spring world or catch users talking about their success stories with Spring and Cloud Foundry! <br><br> Having worked on both the Spring and Cloud Foundry teams, I can say for sure that the sessions and tracks at SpringOne Platform capture Pivotal's core message: Transforming how the world builds software. With these technologies, combined with the power of agile, continuous integration and deployment, you can change the way you build software. We've seen this first hand ourselves. In a world where up until recently, upgrading software would take years, the latest Spring Boot release, Spring Boot 2.0 which was released in March 2018 is already at a whopping <a href="http://www.baeldung.com/java-in-2018?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=s1p&amp;utm_campaign=springone&amp;utm_term=q318" target="_blank" id="" style="color: #00ae9e; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 400;">30% adoption</a>. <br><br> Conferences aren't only about attending sessions. <a href="https://springoneplatform.io/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=s1p&amp;utm_campaign=springone&amp;utm_term=q318" target="_blank" id="" style="color: #00ae9e; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 400;">SpringOne Platform</a> gives you an opportunity to meet the Pivotal Open Source teams and tell us about your needs and experiences with Spring, Cloud Foundry, RabbitMQ, Apache Geode and others. We love listening to feedback that we can take back with us and convert into enhancements to the projects. After all, Spring Boot itself was born from a conference conversation.. <br><br> I hope to see you there, <br></span></p>
