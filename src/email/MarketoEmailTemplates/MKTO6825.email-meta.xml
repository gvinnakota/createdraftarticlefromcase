    <subject>12/12 Webinar - 10 Things Every Developer Using RabbitMQ Should Know</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar 10 Things Every Developer Using RabbitMQ Should Know &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/dec-12-10-things-every-developer-using-rabbitmq-should-know-webinar?utm_source=promo&amp;utm_medium=webinar&amp;utm_campaign=rabbitmq-10things&amp;utm_term=q418]]&gt;, on December 12, 2018. 

RabbitMQ is the most popular open-source message broker. It’s a de facto standard for message-based architectures. And yet, despite the abundant documentation and usage, developers and operators can still get tripped up on configuration and usage patterns. 

Let’s face it: some of these best practices are hard to capture in docs. There’s a subtle difference between what RabbitMQ *can* do, and *how* you should use it in different scenarios. Now is your chance to hear from seasoned RabbitMQ whisperers, Jerry Kuch and Wayne Lund. 

Join Pivotal’s Jerry, Senior Principal Software Engineer, and Wayne, Advisory Data Engineer, as they share their top ten RabbitMQ best practices. You’ll learn:


	- 
How and when—and when *not*—to cluster RabbitMQ 

	- 
How to optimize resource consumption for better performance 

	- 
When and how to persist messages

	- 
How to do performance testing

	- 
And much more!
