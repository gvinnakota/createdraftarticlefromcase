Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

I’m so glad you were part of the SpringOne Platform &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=s1p-alumni-q118]]&gt; experience, and would 
love to have you back again in 2018. SpringOne Platform alumni like you add so much to the quality of the show. 

 I’d like to extend a $100 alumni discount, in addition to the $400 early bird discount, for a total of $500 off your conference pass. I hope you’ll join us September 24-27, 2018 in Washington, D.C. for four days of collaboration, knowledge sharing, good food, and building transformational software. Your attendance will only enrich the community experience and make it another truly epic conference! 

 What to expect this year:


	- 200+ sessions on everything from reactive programming to serverless, machine learning, event-driven architecture, microservices, Kubernetes, and more.
	- Pre-conference training offers a series of hands-on, technical courses.
	- Collaboration, networking and knowledge sharing between leading software companies, enterprises, and cloud experts.
	- Fun after-hours experiences, including Hub Night Out and Hub Socials.


Feel free to use the special SpringOne Platform discount code Attendee_Alumni_100 for an additional $100 off registration &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/register?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=s1p-alumni-q118]]&gt;. If for any reason you are unable to attend this year please feel free to pass this discount code on to your team. 

 Looking forward to seeing you there!
