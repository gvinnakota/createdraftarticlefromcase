 Message from Joe Tucci
 
 CONFIDENTIAL – FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY
 
Last month, Dell announced &lt;[[http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/press-releases/2016-03-28-ntt-data-to-acquire-dell-services]]&gt; a definitive agreement for NTT DATA to acquire Dell Services, which includes Dell’s 
business process outsourcing, application management and infrastructure services.

Dell will continue to provide its customers global support, deployment and professional services aligned to Dell Client Solutions and Enterprise Systems businesses. Following the completion of the Dell/EMC transaction, the Dell and EMC II services capabilities will be combined to form an industry-leading global technology services organization to support customers’ migration from today’s platforms to tomorrow’s technologies and solutions. In addition, the combined Dell and EMC II internal IT organizations will be a showcase for our customers as we help them on their journey to modernize, automate and transform their IT environments and build their digital future.

As we prepare for the largest technology combination in history, I am pleased to share this update from Michael Dell on the future leadership of the combined company, following his earlier announcement that I shared with you onMarch 1:


 - Howard Elias will be President, Global Services and IT, supporting Client Solutions and Enterprise Systems business units and enterprise, commercial, and consumer &amp; small business customers. He will be responsible for global support and deployment, consulting services, technology professional services, and the combined Dell and EMC II internal IT organization.
 - Rory Read at Dell will continue in his role as Chief Integration Officer for the Dell/EMC integration.



The Global Services organization will provide strategic guidance and technology expertise to help customers drive value through IT innovation with a focus on an exceptional total customer experience. The IT organization will encompass the people, technology and systems to deliver the most modern IT experience for the business, customers and partners.

These appointments will become effective immediately upon close of the transaction with Dell. Until then, Howard continues in his current role at EMC responsible for Global Enterprise Services as well as continuing to partner with Rory leading the Value Creation and Integration Office.

We are continuing to make decisions on the future combined business and will keep you updated on our progress. There are still critical decisions to be made about a number of important areas of the new company and much of that work is still ongoing.

We are excited about the progress we are making to combine Dell and EMC, and even more excited about unleashing our unmatched capabilities, solutions and services to help our customers achieve their goals.

Thank you for your hard 
work and staying focused on serving our customers and partners.

Joe
