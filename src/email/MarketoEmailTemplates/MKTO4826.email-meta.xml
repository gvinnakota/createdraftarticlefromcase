Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 
“If Facebook and Netflix can do it, then why can’t we?” Switching to a cloud-native approach isn’t always easy, but it’s certainly possible. Cloud-native isn’t just for Silicon Valley companies; organizations like 80+ year old Allstate have successfully adopted a cloud-native approach and achieved 350% developer productivity improvements, speeding up their business.
 
In this complimentary eBook &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/ebooks/crafting-your-cloud-native-strategy?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=q2-2017-eBook]]&gt;, Pivotal’s Michael Coté addresses the organizational struggles and changes that come with becoming cloud-native and, hopefully, encourages you to get started on your cloud-native journey by providing just enough of a toolkit to bootstrap transformation.
 
The case studies and anecdotes covered in this booklet provide ample lessons from the first few years of early adopters.
 
Specifically, you will read about:
 
 • IT’s role in the era of transient advantage
 • DevOps and agile software practices
 • Organizational change in cloud-native transformations
 • Risk management and security
 • Dealing with legacy applications
 • Using a cloud platform to automate, standardize and  control code deployments
 
Thank you,
