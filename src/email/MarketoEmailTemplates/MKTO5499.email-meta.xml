We enjoyed meeting many of you at SpringOne &lt;[[http://springoneplatform.io/]]&gt; Platform in Las Vegas, NV. The talks were enlightening and the videos will be available on YouTube &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAdzTan_eSPQ1fuLSBhyB4eEZF7JQM0Mx]]&gt;. However, if you can’t wait you can watch Adrian Cockcroft’s closing keynote &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGK6jjamzfY]]&gt; about the movement to simplification. If you want to get involved with Cloud Foundry &lt;[[https://www.cloudfoundry.org/]]&gt;, you might want to consider attending Cloud Foundry Summit Europe &lt;[[https://www.cloudfoundry.org/community/summits/program/about/?summitId=11993]]&gt;, September 26 - 28 in Frankfurt, Germany. 

 This month’s issue covers some important topics that we hope you’ll take the time to read. First and foremost is how we communicate with our customers via the Pivotal Web Services blog &lt;[[https://blog.run.pivotal.io]]&gt; and our status page &lt;[[https://status.run.pivotal.io]]&gt;. Also of importance is our announcement that we will be deprecating our static external IP list &lt;[[https://docs.run.pivotal.io/marketplace/external-ips.html]]&gt;. This will have an impact if you are using this list to open up your firewall. Lastly, we are looking for beta testers for our new TCP Route &lt;[[https://www.cloudfoundry.org/tcp-routing-comes-to-cloud-foundry/]]&gt; feature. 

 Thanks for reading and let us know what you think by tweeting us @pivotalws or contacting us with any questions at support@run.pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:support@run.pivotal.io]]&gt;. 

 Best Regards, 

 The Pivotal Web Services Team 

 Changes, Status and Announcements for PWS: A Conversation 

 Communicating to a large base of customers can be challenging and here at PWS we have tried many means to do this effectively. We have three main channels for communications about changes and updates. 

 The first is the PWS Blog &lt;[[https://blog.run.pivotal.io]]&gt;. We use this channel to keep customers up to date about upcoming changes to the platform such as buildpack and feature changes and product announcements. This is the best channel to stay up to date on upcoming changes to the platform. In addition, we feature case studies, “how tos” and more. 

 The second channel we leverage is the PWS Status Page &lt;[[https://status.run.pivotal.io]]&gt;, which is used to indicate the current status of the platform. This page includes incidents that are ongoing and we are aware of and an automated component status. In addition, you can also look back at past incidents. Something that we are aware of and seeking input on is the granularity and level of incident notification that is meaningful for your organization. A feature of the Status Page is the ability to subscribe to alerts via email and SMS. Therefore, we alert cautiously to avoid paging fatigue. On the Status Page, there are component statuses that are updated by monitoring systems to indicate degraded performance or outages of a specific component of the platform. At this time, we do not track the history of these component changes. Is component change history something your organization requires? If so, please let us know. 

 Our last channel is email communications like this newsletter. We are aware of email fatigue and overwhelmed inboxes, so in addition to our newsletter we use email for limited promotional content, highly impactful system-wide platform changes and terms of service updates that you may need to be aware of. 

 We welcome comments, suggestions and opinions on our platform communications channels. Just email the PWS Product Manager Charles Wu at chwu@pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:chwu@pivotal.io]]&gt; and let us know if our use of email is at the appropriate level. 

 Deprecation of Publicly Visible External IP List 

 Pivotal Web Services (PWS) currently provides a set of externally visible IPs &lt;[[https://docs.run.pivotal.io/marketplace/external-ips.html]]&gt; to enable customers to whitelist traffic from applications hosted on PWS. Some customers use this whitelist to ACL services and resources behind corporate firewalls. This has been at best an incomplete solution. While it allows for a customer&apos;s apps to cross the corporate firewall, it also allows this for any application hosted on PWS. This is a consequence of PWS being a multi-tenant platform. 

 PWS will be making some configuration changes to increase the performance and availability of the platform that will require the current set of public IPs to no longer be supported. We will no longer publish the external IP addresses, nor will these IP addresses remain static. Therefore if your application requires access to services behind a firewall that has been configured with these external IPs, it will be impacted and no longer work consistently after September 29, 2016. 

 The workaround to this change will be to use a service that enables a private static IP addresses that can be utilized by firewall configurations to provide the same functionality. The PWS marketplace offers the Statica &lt;[[https://console.run.pivotal.io/2/marketplace/services/f460748d-1983-4fba-9b7b-f97cd5127854]]&gt; service for this purpose with varying plans to meet your needs. More information can be found in Statica’s documentation &lt;[[http://docs.run.pivotal.io/marketplace/services/statica.html]]&gt;. There are other services that you can consider as well. While we know this causes an inconvenience and potential cost, we feel that this will increase the performance and security offered to your applications. Should you have any questions, please contact support@run.pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:support@run.pivotal.io]]&gt;. 

 Request for Beta Testers of TCP Routing on PWS 

 TCP Routing enables developers to run workloads on PWS that serve inbound requests over TCP protocols other than HTTP. If you have such a workload and would like to help us beta-test the feature, please let us know! Requirements: clients of your application must be able to make requests to the application using a DNS name and arbitrary port (e.g. tcp.cfapps.com:1024); this port will be reserved for your application. In addition, custom domains are not yet natively supported for TCP routing in PWS, but you are welcome to configure DNS for your custom domain to point to the shared domain offered by PWS. If you are interested in being a beta tester for this feature, please contact Shannon Coen at scoen@pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:scoen@pivotal.io]]&gt;.</textOnly>
