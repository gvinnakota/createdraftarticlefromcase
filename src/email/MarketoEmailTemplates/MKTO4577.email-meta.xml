    <subject>Complimentary White Paper: The Upside-Down Economics of Building Your Own Platform</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 
We invite you to download a free copy of our new white paper: The Upside-Down Economics of Building Your Own Platform - You&apos;ve Got a Business to Transform - Get On With It &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/white-papers/the-upside-down-economics-of-building-your-own-platform?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=upside-down-economics_q117]]&gt;. 

Building a platform is hard in and of itself, and if you’re lucky enough to get to a credible 1.0, then you’ve only just begun. The effort and investment required to keep your platform stable, secure, and meeting the needs of your customers can only be justified if it delivers true business value. 

Author Jared Ruckle arms you with the tools and facts you need to effectively discuss and discredit the DIY platform approach. You will be able to persuade your colleagues that, for most companies, a homebrew platform will result in lost time and wasted budget, and ultimately lost market opportunities. 

 The future of your enterprise hinges on your ability to continuously deliver cloud-native applications. Start building apps that add business value today and leave the platform to us.
