    <textOnly>Spring Boot Under the Hood
Speakers: Pieter Humphrey, Nicolas Fränkel
 
With the Spring Boot stack you can kickstart your Spring project in a matter of minutes. For both developers using Spring and microservices adopters, Spring Boot has been a resounding success. 

Favoring Spring Boot over the traditional Spring Framework comes at a cost, you have to let Boot be in control and it might hurt when you decide to get back in the driving seat. 

Come to this 60 minute webinar and discover how auto-configuration and the different flavors of conditionals work through the creation of a Spring Boot starter. You’ll come away with an understanding of Spring Boot internals, how to debug better, and be able to develop your own starter.

Thank you for joining us in advance.
