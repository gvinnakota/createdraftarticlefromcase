Multi-cloud Approaches



 
 
 
 



This month, our editorial focus is on a multi-cloud architecture; distributing applications and data across multiple cloud providers.

 
 

When and why does it makes sense to leverage multiple cloud providers? The resources below explore how Pivotal Cloud Foundry simplifies the complexity of multi-cloud architectures.

MARKETING BEST PRACTICE OF THE MONTH: Partner Page on Pivotal.Io

It’s a cliche, but true. You never get a second chance to make a first impression. And the first thing many prospective customers see is your Pivotal partner page on pivotal.io. So what can you do to make sure customers come away informed and excited to work with you?

First, review the page and make sure it’s written in clear, concise language that conveys the value you help create with Pivotal for customers. Don’t make it all about speeds and feeds but about how the customer will benefit from working with us together.

Second, make sure the page is current! Have you introduced a new Pivotal-related practice or service recently? Make sure it is reflected on your partner page. Remove information that is out-of-date or no longer relevant. Make sure your branding is consistent.

Finally, make that page pop! Add some flare, like a video or a podcast, that keeps customers engaged and wanting more. Did you present at SpringOne Platform 2019? Have you been a guest on Jeff and Dormain’s podcast recently? Add these assets to your partner page on pivotal.io and separate yourself from the pack.

Some of these steps you can do on your own, while others (like adding multimedia assets to your partner page) require a little help from the Pivotal team. Contact your alliances rep and let’s make your partner page unforgettable!




 






 
 
 






 














 















Q&amp;A with Nima Badiey

Nima leads the ISV Ecosystem team supporting all Pivotal software products. His primary goal is to extend the functionality of Cloud Foundry and Greenplum by partnering with leading ISV, SaaS, and software application partners to run their software running on Pivotal. He is a 20-year Silicon Valley veteran, having worked at Sun Microsystem, Deloitte, Flickr, Six Apart, Joyent, and VMware. 



1. What were the most exciting developments in Pivotal’s ISV community in 2018?






When we launched the Pivotal Container Service (PKS) at the end of 2017, our team was very excited to work with ISV partners to build PKS-ready solutions. But the Kubernetes (K8s) ecosystem back then was very nascent. Fast forward a year, and we’ve seen incredible progress by key partners like MongoDB, Elastic, Confluent (Kafka), Crunchy, and Redis Labs adding K8s support to their commercial offerings. We’re also working closely with K8s-native partners such as Aqua, Twistlock and Portworx; augmenting our security and identity solutions with Blackduck, Snyk, Contrast Security, and Cyberark; and adding new capabilities to PCF through integrations with Minio, IBM Websphere, Dell Boomi, CloudBees (Jenkins Core), and many more. 





2. How is Pivotal making it easier for partners to build high-quality integrations with PCF?






Our Platform Engineering team has been building new tools and environments to help partners build and maintain integrations, and provide a consistent high quality customer experience. For example, we created Kibosh and Bazaar to enable K8S’s-based services to be provisionable as marketplace services for PAS apps. We also manage a fleet of PCF clusters for partners (so they don’t have to), and maintain a sophisticated CI pipeline and tile harness to ensure compatibility, installability and upgradeability of every tile on the Pivotal Network. We empathize with customers, so our goal is always to provide the best customer experience. These are just some of the things that set us apart from our competitors.





3. What are you most looking forward to from the ISV partner community in 2019?






For 2019, we’re focused on three things:


	- Recruit the right partners who can help us drive PKS adoption and growth - naturally we’re looking for more ISVs to adopt Kubernetes and PKS as their preferred platform.
	- Partner with VMware and Heptio to amplify the reach our ecosystem partners and our sales funnel - for 2019 we want to work with more EMEA-based ISVs.
	- Expand the portfolio of services and ISV solutions that can run on our platform - run more things on PCF! These are the elements that will spin up our flywheel of growth &lt;[[https://www.jimcollins.com/article_topics/articles/flywheel.html#articletop]]&gt;.</textOnly>
