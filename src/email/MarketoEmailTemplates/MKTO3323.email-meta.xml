    <subject>Pivotal Welcomes Eric Ries as Entrepreneur–in–Residence</subject>
    <textOnly>All,

I’m delighted to welcome Eric Ries—entrepreneur, author, and pioneer of the Lean Startup movement—as Entrepreneur–in–Residence at Pivotal. Eric joins us to further bolster our trailblazing digital transformation capabilities as we help the world’s largest companies innovate and move at startup speeds.

Pivotal’s strategic two-year collaboration with Eric will bring his Lean Startup methodologies directly to our customers, accelerating their digital transformation as enterprises learn how to create software better than a venture-backed startup, and combining that with their decades of industry expertise to allow them to become faster, more agile, and more innovative.

Pivotal has been committed to the development of Lean Startup methodologies since 2010, and has worked with hundreds of companies, including the White House. Since 2014, Pivotal has trained over 250 consultants in Lean Startup practices.

Building on that extraordinary foundation, Eric’s experience, knowledge, and insights will allow Pivotal to become a real School of Disruption. Please join me in welcoming Eric to Pivotal.</textOnly>
