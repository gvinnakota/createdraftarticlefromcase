As software transforms the insurance industry across the world, more companies are embracing software as a core part of their business. Digital transformation isn’t a trend, but a requirement to delivering value to customers.


We cordially invite you to join Pivotal and Prudential for an executive breakfast roundtable to discuss ​digital transformation trends and challenges affecting the insurance industry in Asia.


We are excited to welcome Gregory Kearns, Regional Director of Information Technology Infrastructure and Operations at Prudential, to share and discuss:



	- How insurance companies can build an agile digital strategy to respond to changing market demands and provide personalized client interactions.
	- Navigating the new rules of engagement to generate new revenue streams in the evolving digital era.
	- Digital differentiators for insurance companies of the future and who will survive.



We hope you can join us,
The Pivotal Team
