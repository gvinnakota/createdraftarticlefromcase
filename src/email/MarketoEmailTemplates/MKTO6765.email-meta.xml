    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for Better Deployments with Sub Environments Using Spring Cloud and Netflix 
Ribbon &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/nov-29-better-deployments-with-sub-environments-using-spring-cloud-and-netflix-ribbon-webinar?utm_source=promo&amp;utm_medium=webinar&amp;utm_campaign=netflix-ribbon-spring-cloud&amp;utm_term=q418]]&gt;, on November 29, 2018. 

One of today’s biggest challenges is releasing products more frequently while reducing the negative impact on customers using the system. When not using immutable infrastructure—where all environments are exact copies of each other in the cloud—staging environments are often used to try and mirror production environments. But despite best efforts, discrepancies between environments are common, and can lead to deployment failures. 

During this webinar, we’ll discuss how to use Spring Cloud and Netflix Ribbon capabilities to create sub environments, enabling you to target specific users or groups within a variety of infrastructure environments. This approach lets you gradually deploy changes to the system while reducing the negative impact on customers in production. 

Presenters: 
Roi Ezra, Intel
Liel Chayoun, Intel
