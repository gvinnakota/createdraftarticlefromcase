The first release of the Open Data Platform Initiative (ODPi) is coming soon! Attend this meetup if your company develops, integrates with, or uses Hadoop technologies to learn about the specifications. Find out how you can test your distributions and integrated products to ensure compliance.


There’s still time before the first release to influence the specifications and contribute to the validation test suite!



Important thought leaders within the Hadoop community will be here to answer your questions, and hear your feedback! This is your opportunity to help steer a standard that will become the base for accelerating adoption and innovation of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem.
