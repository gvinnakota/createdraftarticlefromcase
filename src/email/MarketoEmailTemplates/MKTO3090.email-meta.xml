    <textOnly>Team,

Iâ€™m pleased to announce that Project SnappyData (which Jags Ramnarayanan, Suds Menon and Richard Lamb have been leading) will be spun out of Pivotal as a standalone startup, with Series A funding 
coming from the EMC family. We are really excited for this founding team to take the next major step in their journey.

SnappyData is building out a real time analytics engine that leverages Spark, and while this effort is complementary to Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data Suite, Pivotal will not be directly selling the SnappyData product offering.

As part of this transition, the engineering team in Pune, India, will move over to SnappyData. Additionally, the SnappyData team will become the custodian for Gem XD, and take over engineering (L2, L3) support for Pivotal customers using Gem XD.

Moving forward, Anthony Baker is leading GemFire engineering, and Mike Stolz is leading GemFire product. We welcome them in their new roles, and wish them success in taking GemFire to the next level.
 
I want to thank Jags, Suds, and Richard for a decade of committed leadership to the GemFire team, and for their meaningful contributions at Pivotal. I also want to thank the team in Pune for their role in making GemFire the premier IMDG in the market.

The opportunity ahead is extraordinary, and we wish the entire SnappyData team all the best in their exciting pursuits.
