    <subject>6/28 Webinar: Platform Requirements for CI/CD Success—and the Enterprises Leading the Way</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar Platform Requirements for CI/CD Success—and the Enterprises Leading the 
Way &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/jun-28-platform-requirements-for-ci-cd-success-and-the-enterprises-leading-the-way-webinar?utm_source=digest&amp;utm_medium=webinars&amp;utm_campaign=platform-requirements-ci-cd&amp;utm_term=q218]]&gt;, on June 28, 2018. 

All enterprises want to increase the speed of software delivery to get new products to market faster. The means for achieving this is often through the practice of continuous integration/continuous delivery. But speed alone isn’t enough—teams also require the ability to pivot when conditions change. They must ensure their software is stable and reliable, and be able to roll out patches and other security measures quickly and at scale. 

A cloud-native platform coupled with test-driven development and CI/CD practices can help make this a reality. In this webinar, 451 Research’s Jay Lyman presents the results of his research into cloud-native platform requirements for enterprise CI/CD and DevOps success. Pivotal’s James Ma joins Lyman to discuss best practices from DevOps teams charged with running and managing cloud-native platforms, including applying CI/CD to the platform itself. 


Presenters: 
James Ma, Pivotal 
Jay Lyman, 451 Research

Date: Thursday, June 28, 2018
