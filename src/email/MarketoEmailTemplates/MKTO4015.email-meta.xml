    <textOnly>&lt;[[http://pivotal.io/big-data/webinar/how-to-transform-your-business-with-smart-applications]]&gt;
Join Jeff Kelly &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/big-data/webinar/how-to-transform-your-business-with-smart-applications]]&gt;, Big Data Strategist at Pivotal and Doug Henschen, Vice President and Principal Analyst for Constellation Research, as the two explore a fundamental question: What separates the disruptors from the disrupted?
 
It&apos;s clear that data-driven companies are the ones that are taking markets by storm. These are the organizations that have moved beyond rear-view-mirror reports and dashboards to develop predictive and prescriptive insights from big data. These innovators are embedding insights into web and mobile smart applications to trigger actions and offer recommendations at the point of decision. In many cases, the insights are even driving customer-facing applications, leading to the foundation of entirely new business models and significantly higher levels of customer satisfaction.
