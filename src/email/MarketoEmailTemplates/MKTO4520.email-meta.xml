    <subject>Complimentary Report: Gartner’s Market Guide for Application Platforms</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

We invite you to read Gartner’s Market Guide for Application Platforms &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/gartner-market-guide-for-application-platforms]]&gt; to learn about the state of the Application Platform-as-a-Service 
(aPaaS) market, and explore key findings and recommendations. 

 To meet their digital business requirements, companies are looking for platforms that support continuous innovation, developer velocity, DevOps, and new architectural paradigms such as microservices and cloud-native architectures. One important finding of this Market Guide is that as Java EE and other three-tier frameworks, such as ASP.NET &lt;[[ASP.NET]]&gt;, fade in relevance, application leaders must build a strategy which includes alternative platforms that support cloud-native applications. 

 In this report, Gartner’s Anne Thomas and Aashish Gupta provide an overview of application platform strategies and capabilities to help you choose the right one for your modernization initiatives.
