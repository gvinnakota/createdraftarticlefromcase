    <subject>Complimentary White Paper: Operationalizing Data Science</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Everyone knows that data science holds enormous potential value for enterprises. So why is it that so many enterprises struggle to realize that value? The answer is operationalization.

An effective data science practice not only analyzes data for insights, but also includes processes supported by related technologies and tools for surfacing those insights to the right 
people or machines at the right time. It also requires software automation to execute data-driven decisions. 

Read this complimentary white paper &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/white-papers/the-last-mile-operationalizing-data-science?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=q2-2017-WP]]&gt; and learn how to turn potential value into real value by operationalizing data science at scale.
