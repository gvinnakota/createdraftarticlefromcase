Accelerating Development



 
 
 
 



In May, we explored the theme of Accelerating Development across Pivotal’s editorial properties. In truth, the development process is rarely what needs to be accelerated. More likely, it is a combination of the entire stack of people, processes, and technology—everything from CI/CD pipelines to raising up the developers’ level of abstraction.

 
 

Here are some of the featured content from May exploring what makes developers more productive and accelerates development:

What’s coming up next month? Cloud-Native Data is the theme, so look out for blogs, podcasts, webinars and more that are focused on how data fits into the cloud-native picture. Here’s some previous content on this topic to help you join the discussion by publishing your own blog, podcast, or video:

BEST PRACTICE OF THE MONTH: 
Pivotal Editorial Calendar

The Pivotal Marketing team has put together a calendar of content themes that we’re using to organize content thematically throughout the year. While this doesn’t dictate all of the content we publish in a given month, the majority of our content is centered around the theme and sub-theme.

If you’re interested in coordinating on a joint piece of content, a great first step is to check out the themes calendar &lt;[[https://partners.pivotal.io/English/Global/more/recordings.aspx]]&gt; and see if that can act as inspiration for a piece of content.
