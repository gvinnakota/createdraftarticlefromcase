    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Join Duncan Winn as he discusses making sense of the terminology and current trends in IT including: XaaS, Cloud Native, Micro Services, Containers, Agile, Continuous Delivery, Platforms, Abstraction, Dev Ops, IoT, and Reactive Programming... What do all of these terms mean? How should you consume them? 

This talk &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/deciphering-the-buzzword-bingo]]&gt; reviews recent IT trends and how Platforms like Cloud Foundry instigate change, both technically and, more importantly, organizationally. 

For example, how do you structure your teams and how does Cloud Foundry help with Continuous Delivery? The essence of Cloud Foundry is not what it is, or even what it can do, it is about what it can do for you. That&apos;s what this talk will unpack.
