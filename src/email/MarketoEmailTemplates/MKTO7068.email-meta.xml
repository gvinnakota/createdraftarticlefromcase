    <subject>Pivotal Customer Stories: Citi, Volkswagen &amp; Conversant</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Our mission is to transform how the world builds and runs software. I would like to share how three organisations are leveraging our cloud-native platform, advanced tools and software development methodology to deliver exceptional user experiences.

Hear from the digital transformation leaders:

- Citi Adopt Pivotal Cloud Foundry To Accelerate Transformation: https://pivotal.io/citi
- Volkswagen Group Leverage Pivotal Labs to Drive Agile, Lean Application Development Methodologies: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vT902N8UVE
- Conversant Leverage Pivotal Greenplum to Bring Transparency to Online Advertising: https://pivotal.io/customers/conversant

I trust these use cases will help you make transformation real for your organisation.

Regards,

Lionel Lim
Vice President and Managing Director, Asia Pacific &amp; Japan
