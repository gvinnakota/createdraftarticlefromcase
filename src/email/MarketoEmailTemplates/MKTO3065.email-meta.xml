    <subject>Two New Field Video Series on Data</subject>
    <textOnly>Our Data Product and Field experts recently sat down to share their insights on the phenomenal success we’ve had this year, the high expectations for the balance of 2015, and the messaging you’ll need to drive successful Data sales plays. The result was the creation of two new field video series: a Data-specific addition to the “Success in the Second Half of 2015” &lt;https://pivotalfield.biglms.com/success&gt; video series, and a 5–part “BDS Pitch” &lt;https://pivotalfield.biglms.com/course-library?q=53fd53e01bff88b15ce74847&gt; messaging series. These videos will give you an edge in understanding and articulating the value we deliver, as well as provide information that will help you execute in the field.

Please set aside time over the next week to watch each of these informative videos. You’ll need to be logged into the Field Enablement &lt;https://pivotal.biglms.com/field_enablement&gt; site to view them.
