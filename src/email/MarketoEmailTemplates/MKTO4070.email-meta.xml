    <subject>Pivotalâ€™s Principles and Business Conduct Guidelines</subject>
    <textOnly>Team,

Pivotal has three simple core principles:

 - Do the right thing
 - Do what works
 - Be kind

Being true to these principles requires each of us, every day, to act with integrity, empathy, focus and respect, and to comply with the law.

The Business Conduct Guidelines &lt;https://drive.google.com/a/pivotal.io/file/d/0B9d1Z0zuZijhX21nNEw0Rlc3SFE/view&gt; discuss the application of these principles to various business and legal issues that we may face.  Please review and follow them.  The Guidelines also contain a Complaint Procedure &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/pivotal-complaint-procedure&gt;.  If you encounter any ethical, legal or policy violation, you are encouraged to come forward and use the Complaint Procedure.

Thank you for your commitment to Pivotal and its principles. Please feel free to reach out to the Office of the General Counsel at generalcounsel@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:generalcounsel@pivotal.io&gt;, with any questions.
