Pivotal Greenplum 6.0: Enterprise analytics at scale, reimagined for modern deployments

Pivotal Greenplum &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/pivotal-greenplum?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=greenplum-6-q119]]&gt; is a massively parallel processing analytic database based on Postgres, one of the largest and most successful open-source projects. It offers data professionals an escape from proprietary lock-in, while reducing the need for niche data management systems.

What&apos;s New?

For better consolidation of workloads in a single environment, Greenplum now includes significant transaction processing and streaming improvements for faster performance over a variety of analytic-oriented workloads -- up to 50X faster over Greenplum 5 for some applications.


For modern deployments, Greenplum for Kubernetes helps data professionals and developers reap the automation benefits of Kubernetes for easier installation, operation, and upgrades.
