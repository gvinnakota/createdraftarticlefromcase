14 Reasons Data Pros Shouldn’t Miss SpringOne Platform
Isn’t SpringOne Platform for Java developers? If this were 2013, you’d be right. But in 2016, application development and data represent two sides of the same coin. In order for applications to deliver exceptional user experiences, they must be infused with insights gleaned from Big Data analytics and data science. That’s where SpringOne Platform 2016 comes in, with a number of sessions specifically designed to provide data professionals with the knowledge they need to collaborate with developers to create compelling, data-driven software and applications.

Cloud.gov’s Revolutionary Approach To Achieve Continuous Compliance
In this post, two members of 18F—the team behind Cloud.gov—explain how they apply Cloud Native development principles to disrupt the calcified process of compliance in government. Specifically, they discuss how continuous delivery streamlines the process of compliance, including documentation and security for U.S. federal government agencies. Their talk, given at the recent CF Summit, explains how they built Cloud.gov on Cloud Foundry and AWS, what major compliance bottlenecks have existed in the deployment process, and where they are breaking through the problems with new ways of thinking, which they call “continuous compliance.”
