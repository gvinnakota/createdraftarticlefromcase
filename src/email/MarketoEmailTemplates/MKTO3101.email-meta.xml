Pivotal Cloud Foundry 1.6 Now Available
Looking at the similarities for the most successful software companies, there are three development tenets they embrace to achieve true agility: microservices, continuous delivery and DevOps. The latest release of Pivotal Cloud FoundryⓇ (PCF) packages modern Cloud Native software development tools into a turnkey platform. With a new library of core microservices called Spring Cloud Services, expanded support for .NET and Docker deployments, and built-in CI/CD toolchain with support for Cloudbees Jenkins, GitLab, and Jfrog Artifactory, it’s never been easier for enterprise teams to convert to Cloud Native patterns for development, testing, and operations.

Talking Pivotal Cloud Foundry 1.6 With James Watters
November 4, 2015
With a new version of Pivotal Cloud Foundry &lt;https://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal-cloud-foundry/products/pivotal-cloud-foundry-1-6-now-available&gt; out, I wanted to catch up with James Watters to discuss what our customers are up to. We discuss the focus on application architecture and development that we’ve been seeing out in the field. Last we talked, much of the focus was on the infrastructure layer, and while this release has plenty of that, Spring Boot &lt;http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/&gt; and Spring Cloud &lt;http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/&gt; are some of the more interesting features in this release. So, we discuss the more developer-centric context that PCF is running around in now. Tune In &lt;https://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal-cloud-foundry/features/talking-pivotal-cloud-foundry-1-6-with-james-watters?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=pov-newsletter-11-2-15&gt;

Introducing Greenplum: World&apos;s First Open Source

MPP Data Warehouse
October 28, 2015

 
Today, Pivotal unveiled the first massively parallel processing (MPP) data warehouse to open source. The release of Greenplum Database is significant for two important reasons. First, while it is the only open source option for data warehousing, it also leads the industry with query optimization technology that is multiple times faster than any other commercial offering today. Second, it completes Pivotal&apos;s 10 month transition to engage more openly with all the communities we affect—and helping companies of all types on their digital transformation journey. Read More &lt;https://blog.pivotal.io/big-data-pivotal/news-2/introducing-greenplum-worlds-first-open-source-mpp-data-warehouse?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=pov-newsletter-11-2-15&gt;</textOnly>
