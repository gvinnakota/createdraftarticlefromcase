FEATURED SESSION WITH JOSH LONG
Getting Started with Spring Cloud &lt;https://2015.event.springone2gx.com/schedule/sessions/getting_started_with_spring_cloud.html&gt;
 
 Spring Cloud 1.0 is here! It offers a powerful way to create and consume microservices. As you introduce new services, you introduce integration problems: services can be shaky, they can disappear and - as they&apos;re often exposed over HTTP - they require a bit more footwork than in-process method invocations. In this webinar, we&apos;ll focus specifically on how Spring Cloud integrates service registration (e.g.: Eureka, Consul, or Zookeeper), declarative REST clients (with Netflix&apos;s Feign), reactive programming and the circuit breaker pattern with Hystrix to support easy, robust service-to-service 
invocations. This is a deep dive on how to make connect and consume microservices, and is a natural next step after my introduction to building microservices with Spring Cloud.
