The Spring Team &lt;[[http://spring.io/team]]&gt; and Pivotal &lt;[[http://pivotal.io]]&gt; are pleased to present Platform SpringOne &lt;[[http://platformspringone.io/]]&gt; in a bigger and broader format for 2016! SpringOne2GX is transforming into Platform SpringOne—combining Spring with all the other tools, technology, people and processes that 
organizations need to deliver. We’ll cover the entire Spring ecosystem with topics like Web &amp; JavaScript, Data &amp; Integration, Core Spring, and Big Data as you have come to expect, but will also include presentations/workshops on the spectrum from optimizing deployment and operations to leveraging databases and data science in applications.
 
 Platform SpringOne is bringing together the people, process and tools for delivering software services, from startups to large enterprise.  Learn and share lessons from practitioners who leverage modern Java and Spring to solve the entire modern software puzzle—everyone from developers, operators, architects, data scientists to the executive sponsor.
 
 If you are looking for training, technical deep dives or case studies, Platform SpringOne will have something for you. From the cloud native to those just starting the transformation, there will be in-depth advanced technical topics and accessible introductory content covering agile, continuous delivery, devops, microservices, data analytics, machine learning, and more. Join the leaders, experts, authors, your industry peers and community professionals who learn and share every year at the event.
 
 Platform SpringOne will be held August 1–4, 2016 at the Aria Resort &lt;[[https://www.aria.com/]]&gt; in Las Vegas.
