Thank you for visiting Pivotal at VMworld 2015 &lt;http://www.vmworld.com/en/europe/index.html&gt;. We hope you enjoyed learning how organisations are adopting cloud native application architectures to drive modern, software experiences for their customers.

Did you know that we recently announced our intent to deliver Pivotal Cloud Foundry with the VMware Photon Platform as an 
integrated solution for Cloud Native Applications &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal-cloud-foundry/products/next-gen-cloud-native-platform-vmware-photon-pivotal-cloud-foundry&gt;? 

This is an exciting moment for us! It signals an 
important milestone in the evolution of cloud technology. With this solution, companies will fundamentally transform how they deliver and run custom enterprise software for the next decade.
