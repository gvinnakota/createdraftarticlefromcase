A Dive Into the Suite of Grails Spring Security Plugins
 Colin Harrington
 
 Securing your application with Spring Security has been the defacto standard in Grails. There is a suite of plugins at your disposal that give us a great start when securing our applications.
 
 We’ll cover the suite of spring-security related plugins, how they plug into Spring Security and how they interact with each other. We’ll dive into the underpinnings of Authentication Providers, stateless authentication, ACLs and more. 

Creating Application with Grails, Angular JS, and Spring Security
 Álvaro Sánchez-Mariscal
 
 Grails 3.1 enhances and improves the profile system introduced in Grails 3.0. One of the new profiles ease the creation and development of applications where the the front-end is an Angular JS application, and the backend is a Grails REST API. In this session, Álvaro (member of the Grails team at OCI, Grails committer and author of several plugins) will demonstrate how to use the Angular profile to create an application using Grails 3.1, Angular JS and Spring Security REST.
