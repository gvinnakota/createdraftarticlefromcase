Are you being asked to put more cloud in your strategy? If you’re like most IT organizations, the 
answer is a definite yes. At Pivotal, we divide cloud into two distinct parts: migrating as many legacy applications into SaaS as possible and focusing on perfecting the software you build in-house that runs your business. But how do you begin?
 
 Pivotal is excited to announce our webinar series Ensuring Cloud Native Success. This series will profile the journey to becoming cloud native with Michael Coté, Director of Technical Marketing. 
 
 Join us &lt;http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/the-greenfield-journey&gt; on Thursday, December 10 for our first installment 
of the series, The Greenfield Journey, where we will review the top goals and strategies that can help companies and teams deploy greenfield 
projects:


 - Earn trust by showing success
 - Establish a continuous delivery pipeline and cloud platform
 - Learn by doing and educate the rest of the organization



We hope you can join us,
 
 The Pivotal Team
