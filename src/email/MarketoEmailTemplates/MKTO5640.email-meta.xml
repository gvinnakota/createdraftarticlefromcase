    <subject>New Pivotal Microsite for the Orange Community</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


I’m excited to announce that we have recently launched a Orange &amp; Pivotal microsite &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/orangefr?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=email-english-orange]]&gt; dedicated to Orange Group 
Community (all the countries and subsidiaries).

This microsite was built to engage Orange IT &amp; Business Teams on topics like Cloud-Native, Microservices, DevOps, Security and Agile-at-scale, as well as to inform you on recent Pivotal product launches and customer use cases. 

Don’t miss reading the Orange case study and listening to the podcast “Orange is going Cloud-Native”. You may also listen to a presentation from our Senior Vice President of R&amp;D on Pivotal’s 2018 product roadmap. Both can be found on the microsite.

Feel free to share this microsite &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/orangefr?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=email-english-orange]]&gt; with any colleagues who might be interested in Pivotal and/or the topics listed above. Don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions on our joint collaboration. 

Kind regards,
