    <textOnly>This Year in Spring
January 2019
Happy new year, Spring fans! And welcome to a special installment of This Month in Spring, where we look not only at the last month&apos;s news, but also the highlights of the year behind us. 2018 was a year of incredible change on the technology landscape, one that the Spring community has been able to deftly navigate. In this special year-end wrap-up, we&apos;ll do what we always do—look at the latest and greatest in the ecosystem—but we&apos;ll also revisit the things that I, your friendly neighborhood @starbuxman &lt;[[https://twitter.com/Starbuxman]]&gt;, feel most positively impacted the Spring developer in 2018.


Now, let&apos;s get through our usual monthly roundup—and there&apos;s tons to look at!—before we review this Year in Spring.
