    <subject>Pivotal Global Ecosystem November Webinar: Rescheduled Date</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

Due to an unforeseen airport closure, our speaker for the November 14 Webinar was unavailable. 









It has been rescheduled for Monday, November 26 at 11AM PT. If you were previously registered, no need to register again - we will send out an updated calendar event. 

This webinar will cover the impact Pivotal Container Service is having on customers of every size, shape, and industry vertical. We are excited to welcome Chad Sakac, SVP of Global Alliances to discuss the opportunity PKS presents for our partner ecosystem. Chad is deeply embedded in the development of our strategy to make PKS the most complete and enterprise-ready Kubernetes platform. Topics include:



	- PKS and the Pivotal Portfolio
	- Routes to Market
	- PKS Product Update and Roadmap
	- Customer Stories



Thank you for your patience and we are looking forward to seeing you soon!
