    <subject>Thank You for Joining Pivotal at Devoxx Belgium 2015</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Thanks for joining Pivotal and the Spring IO community at Devoxx 
Belgium. We hope you enjoyed learning how enterprises are adopting Cloud Native application architectures to drive modern, software experiences for their customers.  If you’d like a hands on workshop day in your offices or at a nearby hotel, simply inquire here &lt;http://pivotal.io/cloud-native-workshop&gt; to begin a discussion.

In the meantime, start your Cloud Native journey on the Cloud Native microsite &lt;http://pivotal.io/cloud-native-workshop&gt; to 
learn why it matters, what it looks like and how to become Cloud Native.  If you didn&apos;t manage to get one at the conference, you can also get a complimentary, digital copy of Matt Stine&apos;s book on Cloud Native applications &lt;http://pivotal.io/platform/migrating-to-cloud-native-application-architectures-ebook&gt; to learn how to architect and write Cloud Native applications, as well as understand how to deploy and manage 
them. In case you missed anything, here’s a quick recap:
