    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

We know you weren&apos;t able join us on Tuesday for our webinar and wanted to let you know that the on demand replay &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/ensuring-cloud-native-success-organization-transformation]]&gt; is now available. Cot√© profiled the third most common journey that our Pivotal Cloud Foundry customers undertake: organization transformation. We looked at what an IT department that has transformed into a Cloud Native enterprise looks like and how it got there. We covered:


 - The fundamental importance of culture and change
 - How and what IT is doing to support the business
 - How to program the meatware to effectively run inside a Cloud Native organization
