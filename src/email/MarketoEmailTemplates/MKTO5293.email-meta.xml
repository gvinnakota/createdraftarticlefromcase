    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/oct-26-messaging-for-cloud-native-and-migrated-apps-what-s-new-with-rabbitmq-for-pcf-webinar?utm_source=digest &amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=rabbitmq4pcf-q417]]&gt; for the webinar, Messaging for Cloud-Native and Migrated Apps: What’s New with RabbitMQ for P &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/oct-26-messaging-for-cloud-native-and-migrated-apps-what-s-new-with-rabbitmq-for-pcf-webinar?utm_source=digest%20&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=rabbitmq4pcf-q417]]&gt;ivotal Cloud Foundry &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/oct-26-messaging-for-cloud-native-and-migrated-apps-what-s-new-with-rabbitmq-for-pcf-webinar?utm_source=digest%20&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=rabbitmq4pcf-q417]]&gt;, on October 26, 2017. 

Developers choose RabbitMQ for messaging between scalable microservices. It can also act as a bridge to facilitate communication between replatformed or migrated applications and other legacy systems. In this webinar, we&apos;ll review these common use cases and patterns. 


We&apos;ll then introduce the new features of RabbitMQ and RabbitMQ for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF), and explain how they can 
add scale and resiliency. Finally, we&apos;ll discuss the roadmap for both RabbitMQ and RabbitMQ for PCF.

Our agenda includes:


	- 
Introduction of RabbitMQ and RabbitMQ for PCF


	- RabbitMQ patterns for microservices messaging
	- RabbitMQ patterns for application replatforming and migration
	- New features of RabbitMQ and RabbitMQ for PCF
	- 
How to use on-demand clusters of RabbitMQ for PCF

	- 
Roadmap for RabbitMQ and RabbitMQ for PCF
