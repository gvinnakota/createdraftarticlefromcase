    <subject>An exclusive first look at yesterday’s webinar</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

We know you waited quite a while yesterday for our webinar to start. The wait is over!  Your time is valuable, so we’d like to invite you to have a first look &lt;http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/ensuring-cloud-native-success-the-greenfield-journey&gt; at the replay of the session before anyone else. 

Check out the replay &lt;http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/ensuring-cloud-native-success-the-greenfield-journey&gt; 
and slides &lt;http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/ensuring-cloud-native-success-the-greenfield-journey-54828545&gt; of Ensuring Cloud Native Success: The Greenfield Journey, where 
Coté reviewed the top goals and strategies that can help companies and teams deploy greenfield projects:


 - Earn trust by showing success
 - Establish a continuous delivery pipeline and cloud platform
 - Learn by doing and educate the rest of the organization

We’d also like to offer you a hard copy of Matt’s Stine’s Migrating to Cloud Native Application Architectures O’Reilly Book. Email us &lt;mailto:pivotal-operations@pivotal.io&gt; and tell us where to send it! 
 
 Thanks again for your interest in 
our series and we hope you can join Coté and team for Part 2 &lt;http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/ensuring-cloud-native-success-working-with-legacy-it&gt; &amp; Part 3 &lt;http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/ensuring-cloud-native-success-organization-transformation&gt; coming in December.
