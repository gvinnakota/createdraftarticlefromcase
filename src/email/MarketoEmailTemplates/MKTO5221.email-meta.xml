    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Thank you for registering for the Pivotal Analytics Day in Kansas City on September 21st. 

As a reminder the morning sessions are for business and data professionals who want to better understand how to evolve their data and analytics capabilities to meet their business strategies and objectives. We will also be hosting a hands-on training for technical practitioners in the afternoon. Due to technical requirements, this session is limited to the first 20 registrants.

Please bring your laptop for the hands-on workshop. Windows students will need an SSH program installed such as MobaXterm. MacOS students can use the standard terminal application.
