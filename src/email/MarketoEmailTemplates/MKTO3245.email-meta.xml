Apache HAWQ has amazing data federation capabilities. With Apache HAWQ, you can not only read-write or execute SQL queries and advanced analytics natively against Apache Parquet data stores, you can read-write, query, or analyze Avro, Hive tables, JSON and more. Accomplish this seamlessly with Apache HAWQ. Long term, data federation will be extended to ORC.

In this talk, Goden Yao provides a basic architecture overview of Apache HAWQ and adds a deep dive discussion on PXF specifically, including typical use cases and advantages. PXF is a great area to start if you want to contribute to the Apache HAWQ code base.
