    <subject>8/16 Webinar: Mixing Analytic Workloads with Greenplum and Apache Spark</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar Mixing Analytic Workloads with Greenplum and Apache Spark &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/aug-16-mixing-analytic-workloads-with-greenplum-and-apache-spark-webinar?utm_source=digest&amp;utm_medium=webinars&amp;utm_campaign=greenplum-apache-spark&amp;utm_term=q318]]&gt;, on August 16, 2018. 

Apache Spark is a popular in-memory data analytics engine because of its speed, scalability, and ease of use. It also fits well with DevOps practices and cloud-native software platforms. It’s good for data exploration, interactive analytics, and streaming use cases. 

However, Spark, like other data-processing platforms, is not one size fits all. Different versions of Spark support different feature sets, and Spark’s machine-learning libraries can also vary in important ways between versions, or may lack the right algorithm. 

In this webinar, you’ll learn: 


	- 
How to integrate data warehouse workloads with Spark

	- 
Which workloads are better for Greenplum and for Spark

	- 
How to use the Greenplum-Spark connector
