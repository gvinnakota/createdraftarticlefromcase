<p><span style="font-family: 'courier,monospace', courier,monospace;">Hey {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, <br><br> We’ve got our annual conference coming up, the most awesomely named <a href="https://springoneplatform.io/?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=s1p-cote-2018" target="_blank" id="" style="color: #00ae9e; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 400;">SpringOne Platform</a>. I’m most interested in the discussions of how organizations are changing for the better. Well, I actually like to hear how they’re failing, too, but with an eye toward lessons learned rather than just giving up. <br><br> There will also be plenty of technical talks—if you’re interested in that kind of thing—from Spring Boot, to Kubernetes, to microservices, and more on reactive programming than you could ever hope to consume. <br><br> These two buckets of talks—let’s call them meatware and software—cover just about everything that can possibly be known about improving how you do software. We don’t have the 2018 agenda set yet, but check out <a href="https://content.pivotal.io/springone-platform-2017?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=s1p-cote-2018" target="_blank" id="" style="color: #00ae9e; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 400;">the recordings of all sessions from last year</a> for an idea of what it’ll look like this year. <br><br> I mine <a href="https://content.pivotal.io/springone-platform-2017?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=s1p-cote-2018" target="_blank" id="" style="color: #00ae9e; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 400;">these talks</a> all year long for useful anecdotes and advice about (pardon me, here) digital transformation. Here are two examples:</span></p> 
<ol> 
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier,monospace', courier,monospace;">For your initial cloud-native projects, <a href="https://content.pivotal.io/springone-platform-2017/how-to-navigate-the-sea-of-no-jon-osborn-brian-jimerson?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=s1p-cote-2018" target="_blank" id="" style="color: #00ae9e; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 
400;">don’t include only “rockstars” on the team</a>. Otherwise, as Jon Osborn of Great American Insurance covered—<a href="https://content.pivotal.io/springone-platform-2017/how-to-navigate-the-sea-of-no-jon-osborn-brian-jimerson?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=s1p-cote-2018" target="_blank" id="" style="color: #00ae9e; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 400;">among many other topics!</a>—people will discount any success you have (e.g., “Oh, well, that’s because you had a team full of rockstars”). Never mind how depressing it is that those Eeyores think their people are, well, less than awesome. The rest of <a href="https://content.pivotal.io/springone-platform-2017/how-to-navigate-the-sea-of-no-jon-osborn-brian-jimerson?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=s1p-cote-2018" target="_blank" id="" style="color: #00ae9e; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 400;">Jon’s talk</a> is full of practical, real-world advice that his organization has learned.<br><br></span></li> 
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier,monospace', courier,monospace;">Governance is actually easier and better when you put agile and cloud-native infrastructure in place. <a href="https://content.pivotal.io/springone-platform-2017/cloud-native-journey-in-synchrony-financial-michael-barber?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=s1p-cote-2018" target="_blank" id="" style="color: #00ae9e; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 400;">Mike Barber discusses why</a> in his overview of Synchrony Financial’s quest to improve their software factory. As with all these types of talks I like, he also goes through many other lessons learned. (Also, if compliance is really your jam, check out <a href="https://content.pivotal.io/springone-platform-2017/design-for-regulatory-approval-as-carefully-as-you-design-your-automation-keith-rodwell?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=s1p-cote-2018" target="_blank" id="" style="color: #00ae9e; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 400;">a whole talk on that topic from Raytheon’s Keith Rodwell</a>.)</span></li> 
</ol> 
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier,monospace', courier,monospace;">There are <a href="https://content.pivotal.io/springone-platform-2017?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=s1p-cote-2018" target="_blank" id="" style="color: #00ae9e; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 400;">many more talks like this each year</a>, and we’ll have more of the same this year. I know because I’m helping select talks! <br><br> So, listen, you should consider coming. I’ve got a discount code for <strong>$200 off</strong> <a href="https://2018.event.springoneplatform.io/register?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=s1p-cote-2018" target="_blank" id="" style="color: #00ae9e; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 400;">registration</a>, too: <strong>S1P200_Coté</strong>. I think I get, like, a special pen if a lot of people use that code, so, you know: help me get a special pen. Also, if you’re interested in speaking, there’s still time to submit a CFP (it closes on April 15th). I’m happy to help you think through a talk and an abstract—and even help out on your presentation if you’ve got some good content. I’ve done that with several people each year. <br><br> I’ll see you there! <br><br> Coté<br><br> P.S., Early Bird registration and discounted training prices end on May 1, 2018 at 11:59 p.m. PDT. <a href="https://2018.event.springoneplatform.io/register?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=s1p-cote-2018" target="_blank" id="" style="color: #00ae9e; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 400;">Register now</a> and save an additional $400—that’s $600 total—before it’s too late! <br><br></span></p>
