    <subject>Your Ideas for Pivotal&apos;s Financial Health</subject>
    <textOnly>Colleagues,
Pivotal wants to help the world&apos;s largest companies become great software companies. A few short years ago that goal was on the horizon. Today it is a reality. Not only do we have great minds building industry-leading products and delivering transformational services, we have a unique culture that is tangible to our customers. Ultimately, it is this unique approach to software that fuels our success and propels us towards building a self-sustaining company for the long-term.
An important factor to controlling our destiny is financial health—or as I said in the recent Town Hall—understanding our business model around revenues and costs. More specifically, this means considering the many variables that help us build great things and maintain our great work culture. It requires moving towards profitability, which maximizes our flexibility and ability to invest in our business, including the opportunity to go public.
Our recent Series-C investment has allowed us to fund the company, prioritize our investments in the business, and use our resources effectively. Ideally, we’d like to be a self-sustaining business which means minimizing our need for outside funding over time.
We have a ways to go in terms of managing costs; we have some good practices, and some that are unsustainable as we scale. The Pivotal leadership team has discussed at length how to balance making measured changes that have a positive financial impact without negatively impacting our culture—and to change in ways that achieve the greatest good for the most people. It is important for all of us to understand that as we adopt specific policies on travel and other Pivotal spending, it is done in this context.
We invite you to share your thoughts and ideas on how we can do better to eliminate waste and lower costs, by submitting them here &lt;[[https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSebq9-9BpRpw3DFxFxxT8VkkGYEnt1In3QPfJRfPopnmj8TGg/viewform]]&gt;. This is entirely optional and we&apos;re open to any suggestions.
I have helped many companies over the years at various stages of capital investment and growth. The ones that do best are able to prioritize, make choices, and do the right thing for their businesses. Doing the right thing is a cornerstone to how we show up at Pivotal everyday. Pivotal is an amazing opportunity for all of us —for customers, employees, and shareholders.

 
We all have a role to play in helping Pivotal become a self-sustaining company. Thank you for sharing your thoughts and ideas, and if you want to contact me directly, do not reply to this note, but drop me a separate email at: cgaylor@pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:cgaylor@pivotal.io]]&gt;.
