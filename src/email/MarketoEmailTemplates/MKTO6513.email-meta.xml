    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

We invite you to view the webinar recording of Event-Driven Architecture Traps &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/sep-19-event-driven-architecture-traps-webinar?utm_source=emea&amp;utm_medium=webinar&amp;utm_campaign=event-driven-arch&amp;utm_term=q318]]&gt;. 

We have seen an increased demand for event-driven architectures (EDA). Organizations see a great value in them, and developers love how EDA help to grow, scale, and mirror what really happens in the business domain. 

However, most developers are not familiar with this kind of architecture, which can lead to common pitfalls that we’ll examine in this webinar. We’ll also cover a broad set of buzzwords like: exactly-once delivery, Kafka Streams, CQRS, and Spring Cloud Stream. 

There will be live coding, which will require basic knowledge about distributed systems and Spring Cloud.


Presenter: Jakub Pilimon, Pivotal
