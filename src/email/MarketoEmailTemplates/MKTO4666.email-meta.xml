Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 
Dealing with microservices data needs in an ad hoc, cottage industry fashion leads to operational and developer challenges. To reap the full benefits of a microservices architecture, companies need to employ design patterns for their data stores.
 
In this complimentary white paper, In-Memory Data Caching for Microservices Architectures, Pivotal’s Cornelia Davis and Jagdish Mirani explore key areas of consideration for data layer decisions. You will learn how data in a microservices architecture can enable your organization to reap the full flexibility and scalability benefits of microservices.
 
 In the free white paper, you’ll discover how:


 - An in-memory caching layer brings fast response time for both read and write access to data.
 - Asynchronous updates and event-driven architecture protect the autonomy between teams, and allow for high velocity software development.
 - The elasticity and scalability of a microservices architecture is inextricably tied to the elasticity and scalability of the data layer.
 - High availability is a key requirement, and the factors to consider when you are designing for high availability.
 - Legacy systems can be modernized and carried forward into the world of microservices with the help of a caching isolation layer.
 - Pivotal Cloud Cache meets the requirements of caching for microservices architectures.


Pivotal Cloud Cache is a new, integrated caching service for Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Find out how this newly released product &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/blog/supercharging-your-scale-cube-caching-microservices-on-pivotal-cloud-foundry?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=data-pcf-q1-2017&amp;utm_content=blog]]&gt; is a great fit for microservices architectures.

 Keep an eye out for a webinar series about In-Memory Data Caching to be added on the Pivotal webinars resources page &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars]]&gt; very soon and we hope you enjoy the white paper &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/white-papers/in-memory-data-caching-for-microservices-architectures?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=data-pcf-q1-2017&amp;utm_content=white-paper]]&gt;!
