    <subject>Happy Birthday Pivotal</subject>
    <textOnly>As I look back on our first three years, I am so proud of all you’ve done.

We continue to pioneer a disciplined and opinionated approach to modern software development. We have built the modern cloud platform on which the world’s most important companies are building their digital futures. We give many of the world’s biggest enterprises the widest set of modern tools to master analytics.

Software is remaking the world, and Pivotal is remaking software.

Earlier today, on the heels of our third birthday, we announced that Pivotal raised a Series C investment round, highlighted by $253 million in new cash, led by Ford, with the participation of new investor Microsoft as well as all our current investors. It’s a huge endorsement of the transformative nature of our work.

We’re just getting started. This influx of cash gives us the ability to continue building great technology and expanding our global reach.

But today’s announcement is not just about the investment. It’s about who we are and what we stand for. Keep in mind that our values got us here &lt;[[https://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal/features/pivots-are-what-set-pivotal-apart]]&gt;. Keep doing what you’re doing.

Happy birthday to us all.
