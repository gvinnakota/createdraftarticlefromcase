With threats coming fast and furious, it’s essential to apply continuously delivered security to enterprise systems and data to stay one step ahead of bad actors. This month, learn how Pivotal helps customers use automation and frequent updates to keep applications and data safe at scale.

Marketing



   



Last month, we talked about the importance of partner pages on pivotal.io/partners &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/partners]]&gt; and how to make yours stand out. This month we’re highlighting one of the best opportunities of the year to share your message directly with thousands of developers, operators, and business leaders: SpringOne Platform 2019!




 

Upcoming Events






	- Mar - Dec: SpringOne Tour &lt;[[https://springonetour.io/]]&gt; is coming to a city near you!

	- April 2-4, 2019: Cloud Foundry Summit North America &lt;[[https://www.cloudfoundry.org/event/nasummit2019/]]&gt; is coming to Philadelphia

	- Oct 7-10, 2019: Start planning now for SpringOne Platform 2019 in Austin, TX! Please contact us at sponsorS1P@pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:sponsorS1P@pivotal.io]]&gt; about 2019 sponsorship opportunities!










 


MARKETING BEST PRACTICE OF THE MONTH - Take the Stage at SpringOne Platform 2019!
 &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/2019/cfp]]&gt;

We want you, Pivotal partners, to share your wisdom on the main stage or in a break out session at SpringOne Platform 2019, the premier conference for getting hands-on with modern software. The conference, taking place in Austin in October, is one of the best opportunities of the year for you to get in front of thousands of potential customers, from developers and operators to business unit and executive leaders!

But the number of sessions is limited and competition is fierce. How do you set your submission apart from the rest? Bring one of your customers on stage with you! SpringOne Platform attendees want to hear about real-world experiences and lessons learned, so joint submissions that include a customer presenter have the best chance of being selected.

SpringOne Platform 2019 Call for Papers &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/2019/cfp]]&gt; is open now and ends on April 12, so don’t wait. Corral one of your top customers, write a great session description, and submit it today &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/2019/cfp]]&gt;!
