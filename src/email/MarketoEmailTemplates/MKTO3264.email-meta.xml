    <subject>Pivotal Acquires CloudCredo</subject>
    <textOnly>I’m happy to announce that Pivotal has acquired CloudCredo, a fast-growing Cloud Foundry development and services provider, and stayUp, a log analysis technology company for Cloud Foundry. Both companies are privately-held, and based in London.
 
CloudCredo has been synonymous with Cloud Foundry since its inception, becoming one of the most influential companies in the CF ecosystem. I’m very pleased to welcome co-founder and CEO Colin Humphreys, COO Paula Kennedy, and the entire CloudCredo and stayUp teams to Pivotal.
 
CloudCredo’s managed and consulting services help 
customers deploy Cloud Foundry without steep learning and investment curves. By lowering the costs of failure, CloudCredo helps customers quickly release, iterate, and ultimately innovate.
 
CloudCredo and Pivotal have worked closely for some time now; Colin was the first developer 
to attend our CF Dojo in San Francisco, and his team have helped us to develop many of our CF services. His vision to change the way the world delivers services has been deeply influenced by Pivotal, and our mission to transform how the world builds software.
 
During a recent media interview, Colin was asked, 
“Why Pivotal?” He responded, “We’ve been heavily influenced by Pivotal; hence, it feels like we’re coming home.”
 
The CloudCredo and stayUp teams will remain London-based, and join our technical Cloud Foundry teams. Read more about today’s announcement in Onsi Fakhouri’s conversation with Colin, here &lt;[[https://blog.pivotal.io/?p=35584]]&gt;, and please join me in welcoming the CloudCredo and stayUp teams home.</textOnly>
