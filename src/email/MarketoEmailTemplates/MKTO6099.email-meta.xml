    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar Next-Generation Spring Data and MongoDB &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/jun-20-next-generation-spring-data-and-mongodb-webinar?utm_source=digest&amp;utm_medium=webinars&amp;utm_campaign=spring-data-mongodb&amp;utm_term=q218]]&gt; on June 20, 2018. 

MongoDB 4.0, scheduled for release in Summer 2018, will add support for multi-document ACID transactions. Through snapshot isolation, transactions will provide a consistent view of data, and enforce all-or-nothing execution to maintain data integrity. Transactions in MongoDB will feel just like transactions developers are familiar with from relational databases, and will be easy to add to any application that needs them. 

The addition of multi-document transactions will make it easier than ever for developers to address a complete range of use cases with MongoDB, although for many, simply knowing that they are available will provide critical peace of mind. The latest MongoDB 3.6 server release already ships with the main building block for those, client sessions. 

The Spring Data team has implemented synchronous and reactive transaction support in preparation for the MongoDB 4.0 release, built on top of MongoDB sessions. Learn more about Spring Data MongoDB, and many new capabilities in the forthcoming Spring Data Lovelace release!
