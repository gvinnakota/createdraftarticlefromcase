    <subject>Google Cloud Next is over. Now let&apos;s get to work building software</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi there,
 
 Do you think Google is serious about the enterprise cloud business? We think so. It’s hard to come to any other conclusion after two days of Google Cloud Next London. Besides industry-leading data and machine learning services, Google unveiled some innovative changes to pricing and support.

Google’s relationship with Pivotal, and how together we help you deliver better apps at scale, was also featured throughout the week. Highlights included:


 - Pivotal is Google’s first CRE partner &lt;[[https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/03/reimagining-support-for-Google-Cloud-Platform-new-pricing-model-and-partnerships.html]]&gt;. The Customer Reliability Engineering (CRE) program from Google Cloud is a unique way to ensure that you’re getting Google-scale best practices in your software. We want to drive your “anxiety towards zero &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/announcements/pivotal-cloud-foundry-and-google-cre-together-driving-customer-anxiety-towards-zero?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=global-event-google-next-london-q217]]&gt;” by improving software reliability and quality.
 - Build and manage Kubernetes clusters using BOSH with Kubo &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/announcements/pivotal-cloud-foundry-and-google-cre-together-driving-customer-anxiety-towards-zero?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=global-event-google-next-london-q217]]&gt;. BOSH is a powerful tool for creating and running distributed systems. It’s powered Cloud Foundry for years! Pivotal and Google worked together to deliver Kubo &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/kubo?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=global-event-google-next-london-q217]]&gt;, an open-source project that combines BOSH and Kubernetes as a way to simplify your life.
 - Google named Pivotal their Google Cloud Technology Partner of the Year &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/announcements/pivotal-recognized-as-2016-google-cloud-technology-partner-of-the-year?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=global-event-google-next-london-q217]]&gt;. We’ve got an excellent relationship with Google, and they agree! You can be sure that you’ll continue to get leading innovation from a premier platform running atop a premier public cloud.
