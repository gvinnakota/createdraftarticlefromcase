    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

In the past years of big data “euphoria”, Hadoop and Spark received most of the attention as platforms for large-scale data management and analytics. Data warehouses based on relational database technology came under scrutiny as perhaps no longer needed. However, if there is anything users have learned recently it’s that the mission of data warehouses is as vital as ever. 

 Today’s digital transformation growth has created vastly more data along with the need for that data to be analyzed quickly. Cloud-based, open source, massively parallel and scalable relational databases play a vital role. An evolved data warehouse implementation can help aide digital transformation. 

 In this free white paper, written by Neil Raden, you will read about:

 - Digital transformation and the rise of “Instantology” 
 - What value data warehouses provide now 
 - The virtual data warehouse 
 - Making the Hadoop/Spark decision versus Relational 
 - Customer case studies
