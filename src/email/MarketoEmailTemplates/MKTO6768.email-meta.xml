    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

At Pivotal, we are committed to transforming how the world builds and runs software. To learn how you can make transformation real for your organisation, I thought you might be interested in the upcoming events:

*Meetups - Cloud Foundry as a PaaS, CaaS and FaaS*

Here we&apos;ll discuss how Cloud Foundry - the Open Source Multi Cloud Platform helps enterprises run all the application abstractions with one underlying software. We&apos;ll also look at an application which has parts of it&apos;s services running on PaaS, CaaS and FaaS and how it all fits together on Cloud Foundry.

*Live Webinar - Any Workload Any Cloud*

With all the hype about moving to the cloud, the reality is that a large percentage of enterprise workloads still run on-premises due to technical complexity, data privacy, and security concerns. So how do you future-proof your business by introducing layers of abstraction that allow you to run any workload on any cloud?
