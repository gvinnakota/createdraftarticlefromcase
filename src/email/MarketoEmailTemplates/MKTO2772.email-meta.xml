    <subject>Thank You for Joining Pivotal at OSCON 2015</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

It was great meeting you at OSCON! We’re going to conferences like OSCON to show you some real cool 
ways the open source community is driving IoT innovation, cloud native application development, and open software collaboration.

We had a bunch of really smart industry experts and technologists 
who hosted hands-on labs and demos, giving you direct access to Pivotal products for you to play around with. We had so much fun showing the crowd how to build an app that consumes data streamed from connected devices, and apply advanced real-time analytics. 

If you are weren’t able to catch our one of our talks or our hands-on IoT lab, here’s a recap:


 - Spencer Gibb gave a talk on Microservices with Spring Cloud and Netflix OSS &lt;http://www.oscon.com/open-source-2015/public/schedule/detail/41041&gt;
 - Fred Melo &lt;http://www.oscon.com/open-source-2015/public/schedule/speaker/210563&gt; and William Markito Oliveira &lt;http://www.oscon.com/open-source-2015/public/schedule/speaker/196748&gt; hosted a Hands-On Workshop: Building Internet of Things (IoT) Apps on Open Source &lt;http://www.oscon.com/open-source-2015/public/schedule/detail/44875&gt;
