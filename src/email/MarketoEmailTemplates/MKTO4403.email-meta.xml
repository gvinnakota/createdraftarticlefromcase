    <subject>Thank You for Joining Pivotal at QCon San Francisco 2016</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 
Thank you for joining Pivotal and the Spring community at QCon SF &lt;[[https://qconsf.com]]&gt;. We hope you enjoyed learning how enterprises are adopting cloud-native application architectures to drive modern, software experiences for their customers. If you’d like to talk to us about arranging a hands on workshop in your offices or at a nearby hotel, simply inquire here &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/cloud-native-workshop]]&gt; to begin a discussion. 
 
 In the meantime, if you are looking for spare capacity for CI builds, temporary development or test environments, check out Pivotal Web Services &lt;[[http://run.pivotal.io]]&gt;, a great public cloud for running Spring (and .NET) on Cloud Foundry! Don’t forget to your free copy of the O’Reilly eBook, Migrating to Cloud Native Applications &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform/migrating-to-cloud-native-application-architectures-ebook]]&gt; on the Pivotal site, a useful primer for IT management on why cloud-nativematters. 
 
 In case you missed anything, here’s a quick recap:
