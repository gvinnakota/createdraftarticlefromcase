    <subject>Thank You for Joining Pivotal’s Spring speakers at QCon New York 2016</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 

 Thank you for joining Pivotal and Spring speakers at QCon New York. We hope you had the opportunity to learn how and why enterprises are adopting Cloud Native application architectures to drive modern software experiences for their customers. 

 Start your Cloud Native journey on the Cloud Native microsite &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/cloud-native]]&gt; to learn why it matters, what it looks like, and how to become Cloud Native. When you or your manager are ready to dive a little deeper, we suggest O’Reilly’s Migrating to Cloud Native Applications &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform/migrating-to-cloud-native-application-architectures-ebook]]&gt; &amp; Beyond 
the Twelve-Factor App, freely available on the Pivotal site. If you want to dive right in, we could arrange a hands-on workshop day at your offices or at a nearby hotel. Simply inquire here &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/cloud-native-workshop]]&gt; to begin.

 In case you missed the Pivotal talks at QCon New York, here’s a quick recap:

 - Rossen Stoyanchev gives a comprehensive view of Reactive Programing for Java Developers &lt;[[https://qconnewyork.com/ny2016/presentation/reactive-programming-java-developers]]&gt;—starting with JDK 9, Reactive Streams, to Spring Framework and even ecosystem topics around data 
access, to the role of Project Reactor and RxJava 
 - Mark Pollack’s talk on A Microservice Based Architecture for Stream Processing using Spring Cloud Data Flow &lt;[[https://qconnewyork.com/ny2016/presentation/microservice-based-architecture-stream-processing-using-spring-cloud-data-flow]]&gt; shows us how Spring Boot stream 
processing applications can be decorated with Kafka and RabbitMQ messaging, with or without a high level DSL, to a variety of runtimes.
