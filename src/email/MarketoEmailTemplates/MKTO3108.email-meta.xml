On October 28th, Pivotal unveiled the world’s first massively parallel processing (MPP) 
data warehouse to open source: Greenplum Database &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/big-data-pivotal/news/introducing-greenplum-worlds-first-open-source-mpp-data-warehouse?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=Global_Product_GPDB_Ignite_campaign_Email%20#2_Q415&gt;. Built over the past 10 years, with nearly two million lines of code, Greenplum Database is the last of our core data solutions to be released under the Apache Software 2.0 license.
