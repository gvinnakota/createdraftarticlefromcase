    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},



That webinar you signed up for in July? “Which Application Modernization Pattern Is Right For You?”? Well Shaun and Prithpal dropped some serious knowledge about replatforming and modernizing applications, such as:


	- The 5 reasons to modernize or replatform
	- The 2 approaches to strangling a monolith
	- How to make it easier to find what to modernize first


If you haven&apos;t watched the replay yet, I highly recommend it. If you have, well you&apos;re probably event-storming up a storm (okay, that was funny in my head).


Or maybe you’d love to have someone like Shaun work with your organization to replatform some of your applications onto Pivotal Cloud Foundry? Let us know. &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/contact]]&gt;


In the meantime, here are some more ways to learn about replatforming and application modernization with Pivotal and Apigee:


	- Learn more about Replatforming &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/replatforming]]&gt;
	- Read about Apigee’s integration with Pivotal Cloud Foundry &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-marketplace/application-tier-networking-and-gateway/apigee]]&gt;
	- Watch a replay of the class, “Journey to Cloud-Native: Where to Start Your App Modernization Process” &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/replatforming/journey-to-cloud-native-where-to-start-in-your-app-modernization-process-2]]&gt;
	- Register for SpringOne Platform &lt;[[https://2017.springoneplatform.io/ehome/s1p/registration]]&gt;, where you’ll hear stories from companies that have replatformed and modernized their applications


Thank You,
