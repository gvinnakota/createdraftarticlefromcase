    <subject>Pivotal Global Ecosystem October Webinar: Application Transformation</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}}, 


At the Partner Summit preceding SpringOne, VP of Platform Architecture Raghvender Arni suggested the best way to grow your AppTx practice was to spend time with Matt Russell. Well, now is your chance! Come hear the man himself, Matt Russell, talk about how large organizations plan and execute their application transformation, and how partners make it possible.

We&apos;ll be covering:


	- Pivotal&apos;s approach to Application Replatforming - from operational to strategic

	- How customers are driving growth and staying competitive through legacy application transformation
	- How partners are critical to Pivotal&apos;s go to market strategy to help transform how the world builds software



Looking forward to seeing you there!
