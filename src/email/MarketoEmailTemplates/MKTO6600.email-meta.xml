    <subject>11/28 Webinar - Continuous Delivery to the Cloud: Automate Thru Production with CI + Spinnaker</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar Continuous Delivery to the Cloud: Automate Thru Production with CI + 
Spinnaker &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/nov-28-continuous-delivery-to-the-cloud-automate-thru-production-with-ci-spinnaker-webinar?utm_source=promo&amp;utm_medium=webinar&amp;utm_campaign=ci-spinnaker&amp;utm_term=q418]]&gt;, on November 28, 2018. 

To continuously deliver software to the cloud, companies must adopt critical capabilities that ensure the safety, security, scalability and traceability of deployed 
applications—from development hand-off through production release. 

Pivotal built a deep integration with Spinnaker, an open source continuous delivery platform, and Cloud Foundry (CF) to automate the full path to production. Spinnaker complements and extends the capabilities of continuous integration (CI) tools, including Concourse, to enable developers to ship code rapidly with increased confidence and greater visibility, as well as provide full auditability and operational control of applications. 

Spinnaker functions as an application-centric control plane, abstracting the details of cloud platforms not relevant to developers and organizing cloud resources around applications. It provides opinionated building blocks to perform common actions and allow deployment pipelines to be assembled consistently and as needed. Spinnaker’s pipeline workflows support more advanced rollout mechanisms like blue/green deployments, conditional deployments, time window restrictions, and automated canary analysis. Spinnaker also facilitates “in production” application testing, stressing and scaling. 

In this webinar, you will learn how: 


	- 
Continuous delivery practices complement and extend continuous integration, enabling consistent, safe production releases 


	- 
Spinnaker works with CI solutions to execute complex, rule-driven, cloud-provider-integrated, high-volume 
deployments

	- 
Spinnaker’s multi-cloud asset inventory supports construction of further operational tools like chaos engineering, 
zero-day security vulnerability scanning, and autoscalers



We’ll also demo a Spinnaker pipeline so you can see continuous delivery to PCF in action. 

Presenters: 
Jon Schneider, Principal Software Engineer 
Olga Kundzich, Senior Product Manager 
Pat Johnson, CI/CD Product Marketing

Date: Wednesday, November 28, 2018
