2. Pivotal Saved You MONEY. Here’s How.


After working with Pivotal, the US Air Force, learned to code using agile methodology resulting in fuel cost savings of $1M every single day. Think about that. If you are a tax-paying American, you just saved $365M per year and put a stop to the $745M spent with a big defense contractor which produced nothing in 5 years, according to Fast Company &lt;[[https://www.fastcompany.com/40588729/the-air-force-learned-to-code-and-saved-the-pentagon-millions]]&gt;. It’s quite an impressive transformation. When you come across this t-shirt &lt;[[https://kessel-run-af.myshopify.com/]]&gt;... now you know what it means. #agileAF \o/



 


 



 


 


3. Analyst to Quote
 
Forrester conducted a Total Economic Impact analysis &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/analyst-reports/the-total-economic-impact-of-pivotal-cloud-foundry]]&gt; of 
customers to gauge the Return on Investment (ROI) of Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Using a stringent methodology among customers with many years experience, they calculated an ROI of an astounding 136%. There’s nothing more exciting than giving your customer some cache back (nerdy pun intended) at the end of the quarter.



 


 



 


 


4. What You May Have Missed
 
Niki Allen, Boeing’s Director of the Office of the CIO and Chief of Staff spoke at Pivotal’s Spring One Platform Conference last year. What she has accomplished at Boeing is nothing short of inspiring. Boeing has 150,000 employees, 20,000 suppliers across 65 countries and just one single flight of a 787 dreamliner generates 1TB of data. Clearly, the size and level of complexity is immense and the opportunity is enormous. Boeing wasn’t born digital. Listen to how Niki spearheaded the transformation in the below video.

Another step in that direction has launched THIS WEEK, it’s a webpage exclusively dedicated to the needs of Dell Tech Sales, called Pivotal Pulse &lt;[[https://partners.pivotal.io/English/General_DT_Info.aspx]]&gt;.

Kindly,
Courtney
