2H SPIFs Update
Announcing a new SPIF for Sales reps who resell CloudBees. 
Sales Reps will be awarded either $1K, $2K, or $4k depending on the size of the SKU (see chart below). List price is non-discountable. For full details, please visit FY15 Compensation SPIF deck &lt;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zOCuVNQX7vEa0F1zoTu1EA6V0GavDFHWDErktdkEEqU/edit#slide=id.gc36c4b54f_0_0&gt;.

 
 Subscription Club Event Dates and Location Confirmed. In August we announced a new second-half SPIF to drive 
subscription sales. If you achieve your second-half quota for subscription software, you&apos;ll become part of the &quot;Subscription Club,&quot; which earns you and your partner an awesome weekend adventure with top Pivotal salespeople from around the world.

As you read in Bill’s note, this four-day, three-night adventure will take place on May 21—24 2016, at the W Hotel &lt;http://info.pivotal.io/CUp00H0qN2rI0ACP2N0dJ0e&gt; in South Beach, Miami, Florida—otherwise known as the American Riviera. We took a quick look at those of you in the running for the Subscription Club, and the current tally stands at more than 50 people. Calculations are based on 3rd-quarter actuals, plus 25% of the pipeline for the 2nd-half. We included anyone that is &gt;70%. Note: Your subscription goal is the software threshold for your second half total goal, 50% of your second half goal in Americas, and 70% in EMEA and APJ. We&apos;ll post the leaderboard periodically, so get your deals rolling!
