    <subject>Pivotal Breakfast Invite: Hear Service NSW&apos;s Transformation Journey</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

I would like to invite you to a breakfast Pivotal are hosting in Sydney on the 27th March on the topic of Driving Innovation with Application Transformation. While organisations are placing priority on driving business innovation, this effort is often hindered by outdated platforms, antiquated tools and lengthy processes.

REGISTER: https://connect.pivotal.io/Sydney-Breakfast-March19.html

At this event you will hear from Lawrence Crowther, CTO APJ, Pivotal and Georgos Papanastasiou, Director Product Management, Service NSW on why your organisation needs application transformation in order to truly drive innovation within your business, as well as the key AppTx principles to modernise your application portfolio.

Registration opens at 8:00am, with the formalities commencing from 8:30am and wrap up at 10:15am.

Should you not be able to attend our Sydney event, join us at the Melbourne breakfast on 2nd April: https://connect.pivotal.io/Melbourne-Breakfast-April19.html

Regards,

Lionel Lim
