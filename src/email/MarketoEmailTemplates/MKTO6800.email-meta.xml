    <textOnly>Does this sound familiar: As a product manager, you’ve finally got a groomed backlog that aligns with the product vision and roadmap. Teams are cranking away and delivering. Everything is on track and then it happens—some unplanned work pops up that is deemed URGENT by someone outside your department. All eyes are on you to set the priority—do you have the tools to do it?

Join our panel discussion for tips, tricks, and answers, as The Product Stack welcomes Teresa Torres, Product Discovery Coach and founder of Product Talk; Aloka Penmetcha, Director of Product Management at Pivotal; and Jim Semick, Co-Founder of ProductPlan.

- What to do when unplanned work pops up
- Proven prioritization frameworks to help you tame the never-ending feedback chaos
- How to communicate delays to stakeholders
- Roadmapping best practices for agile dev teams
