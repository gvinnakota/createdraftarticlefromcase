    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 
Per your request, we&apos;re emailing to let you know that the second post in our Cloud-Native Operations in 6 Parts: Super Suit Not Required &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/blog/cloud-native-operations-in-6-parts-super-suit-not-required]]&gt; series is now live.
 
 Part #2: Automated Ops; Freedom To Innovate &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/blog/automated-ops-freedom-to-innovate]]&gt; by Pivotalâ€™s John Allwright, is a two-part blog post that takes a look at how a cloud-native platform automates traditional undifferentiated heavy lifting, repetitive ops tasks and how this transforms the role of the ops 
team from keeping the lights on to driving business success. John will also look at how cloud-native operations open up the possibility of evolving the procedural Infrastructure-as-Code to the declarative Infrastructure-is-Code with BOSH &lt;[[https://bosh.cloudfoundry.org/]]&gt;.
