From What Might Be

Steve Casale &lt;[[https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1033819-stephencasale]]&gt;, Sr. Manager, Corporate Communications
The odyssey starts like this: a senior software engineer at (insert company) leads a small team into uncharted software territory. An overgrown forest of grey, Dilbert-era cubicles get ripped out. The place brightens up, and as people pair, conversation overtakes the muted clacks of keyboards. Develop in Ruby, but Java not so much? No problem. The team tries out Pivotal Cloud Foundry, with buildpacks that let you code in your language of choice. Testing is done early and often, so decisions are made at the line of the code, which results in the team surprising themselves by shipping in weeks instead of months or even years. 

 Success ripples across the organization–and it can get lonely steering the team through waterfall bumps and mindsets. The beachhead is there though, and over time a number of teams pop by to see what &quot;team agile&quot; is up to. Many of them sign up. 

 I had the luck to sit in a Tuesday talk in our New York office to listen to exactly that scenario play out from a Home Depot engineer–the third story I&apos;ve heard like that in the past month from a Pivotal customer on what software can do, team by team, for their businesses. 

 Pivotal has traction, and in this issue, Analyst Relations lead Rita Manachi writes on the hard efforts and the generous yield of reports and updates–which you should use–that show our signal is strong and being picked up in our Business Update. Stephan Hagemann sends a dispatch from Pivotal Berlin in our Agile Update, and Dan Podsedly writes how Tracker continues to improve for the startup faithful, as it scales up for enterprise adoption in our Product Update. 

 June is Pride month in the US. Criss-crossed as it was by tragedy in Orlando, Pivotal offices rallied in their own way, coloring up walls with rainbows and writing notes of support. Transforming how the world builds software is not going to change many currents of hate and fear (as one Pivot tweeted recently, it&apos;s shocking how easy it is to be cruel). But by creating safe zones for teams and customers to try new things, and for Pivots to collectively show up on &apos;people matters&apos;, I hope we continue to show up on humanity&apos;s better side. 

 Here&apos;s to safe zones to code and live in, openly. 

 Call to action: If you or your customers are attending SpringOne Platform &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/]]&gt; (Pivotal-hosted, and our most important event of the year), please ensure that you and your customers book hotels by Friday, 1 July &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/corporate-marketing/events/springone-platform-2016?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=springone]]&gt;! (Prices could go up significantly after this date.)
BUSINESS UPDATE
 Analyst Relations—Advancing the Frontlines
 Rita Manachi, Analyst Relations Lead
It&apos;s been seven months since I began my adventures in Analyst Relations at Pivotal, and we&apos;ve got some real momentum with analysts who now recognize Pivotal&apos;s powerful value proposition and market influence! We&apos;ve had more than 50 interactions with analysts including inquiries, briefings, customer calls, and meetings since December. 

Here are some useful updates, insights and articles:



 - We met with analysts from Gartner, Forrester, and 451 at the OpenStack summit &lt;[[https://www.openstack.org/videos/summits/show/6]]&gt; in Austin, Texas, sponsored an analyst breakfast at the Cloud Foundry Summit with a panel of Pivotal customers Comcast, CoreLogic, and Express Scripts International. Forrester, IDC, and RedMonk wrote about it, and you can read excerpts from these pieces on the AR site &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/departments/analyst-relations]]&gt; on Inside Pivotal, and find RedMonk&apos;s overview here &lt;[[http://redmonk.com/fryan/2016/06/07/cloud-foundry-summit-lots-done-more-to-do/]]&gt;. 

 - Gartner published the 2016 Magic Quadrant &lt;[[http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/methodologies/research_mq.jsp]]&gt; for Enterprise aPaaS in which Pivotal was not included; you can read how to respond to that here &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/departments/analyst-relations/reports-for-customers/reports-for-paas-cloud/howtorespondquestionsaboutgartnerapaasmagicquadrant]]&gt;, and find a link to excerpts from that report. 
 - Pivotal is featured in two reports from Forrester: One on microservices, and another on the future of application development. You can read excerpts from all these reports on the Analyst Site &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/departments/analyst-relations/market-insights]]&gt; (don&apos;t forget to scroll down to see all the goodness). 

 - Two reports from 451 highlight the Hortonworks deal &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/big-data/analyst-report/pivotal-and-hortonworks-expand-relationship-with-hdb-sql-on-hadoop-reseller-deal]]&gt;, and our Series C funding and latest PCF release &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform/analyst-report/pivotal-raises-big-funding-round-updates-flagship-paas]]&gt; (You can share these with any interested parties). 

 - Two new, Pivotal-commissioned reports from the IDC on pivotal.io provide complementary insights on the role of on Agile development &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/agile-transformation-in-the-age-of-the-third-platform]]&gt; and cloud 
architectures in transformation. Both are worthy reads. 



We&apos;ve also been collaborating with technical evangelist Michael Coté on a series of webinars with 451 &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/agile/webinar/perfecting-the-software-life-cycle]]&gt;, Constellation Research &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/platform-and-cloud-portability]]&gt;, while Andrew Clay Shafer is featured in a podcast series &lt;[[https://soundcloud.com/monkchips]]&gt; with RedMonk&apos;s James Governor to raise awareness of SpringOne Platform &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/]]&gt;. These podcasts can be found on SoundCloud &lt;[[https://soundcloud.com/monkchips]]&gt;. 

 Finally, you can find the latest analyst insights on hot topics such as containers, and much more in the Market Insights section &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/departments/analyst-relations/market-insights]]&gt; of the AR site. Despite having a three-year lead on these technologies and vendors, container offers are starting to look a lot more like PCF, and we can expect the likes of Docker to bring some competition to the space. 

 The next big thing is our very first Pivotal Analyst &quot;mini-summit&quot; at the coming SpringOne Platform &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/]]&gt; event, where we will get our analysts, customers, and Pivotal executives together. See you next quarter!

PRODUCT UPDATE
 Tracker–Going Bigger, Staying True
 Dan Podsedly, GM Pivotal Tracker
Last you heard from Pivotal Tracker &lt;[[https://www.pivotaltracker.com/]]&gt;–the ultimate agile software management tool–we had just moved into the new Pivotal office in Denver. Much of the past year has been spent settling into that space–literally and figuratively–and team has grown significantly. We&apos;ve hired some great people, including engineers, a designer, and a product manager. As we continue to grow, we&apos;re seeking more engineers and a UX/product designer. 

 We continue to adapt Tracker to serve the needs of start-ups, while bringing it to enterprises, at scale. 

For starters, we released a new Analytics tools &lt;[[http://www.pivotaltracker.com/community/tracker-blog/pivotal-tracker-analytics-now-out-of-beta]]&gt; to help teams uncover bottlenecks and improve team performance. A variety of charts and reports give teams the ability to quickly assess overall project progress and to dive deeper into project details. The response so far has been overwhelmingly positive, and the feedback will help us improve &lt;[[http://www.pivotaltracker.com/community/tracker-blog/how-customer-pms-helped-us-design-tracker-analytics-v1]]&gt; Analytics over time. 

 We also unveiled a new Help Center &lt;[[http://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/]]&gt;, a fully searchable site with videos, articles, tips, and contacts on all things Tracker. 

 We&apos;ve stayed focused on Tracker usability improvements, including search sharing, improved bulk actions, improved commits on stories, linking directly to comments, and more &lt;[[http://www.pivotaltracker.com/community/tracker-blog/tag/updates]]&gt;. And while we continue to refine our already successful iOS app, we debuted our Android app &lt;[[http://www.pivotaltracker.com/community/tracker-blog/android-update-version-0-9]]&gt;, and have a big update coming in the near future. 

 Tracker users can also expect performance, stability, and story workflow improvements—we address story blockers to help teams uncover and remove impediments, and maintain project velocity. Other features will also bring a new level of visibility to the continuous delivery pipeline, starting with improved GitHub integration. 

 We have big things in the works for the remainder of 2016. We’re moving Tracker to its new home on Pivotal Cloud Foundry on AWS to take advantage of all of the benefits our platform brings. We’re also launching a version of Tracker focused on enterprise customers, with features including single sign on, wide project visibility, improved dashboard, and comprehensive data retention. 

 As we progress and grow this year, Tracker is looking forward to a bigger role in Pivotal&apos;s enterprise play, while continuing to meet the needs of startups everywhere.
AGILE UPDATE
 In Berlin? ... Yes!
 Stephan Hagemann, Berlin Office Director
Becoming a digital company today can entail a seismic shift for many enterprises. As observers have noted for some time, the digital forces in industries everywhere create both fear (of disruption) and hope (that transformation will spur enterprises to innovate at start-up speeds).



For enterprises old and new, being ready to adapt is crucial. The process can be daunting, filled as it is with variables and unknowns. While many industry titans understand the nuances for adaptation today and see the charge and innovation it can yield, many ask a similar question: Where to start?



One of the most well known UK supermarket chains provides a good example of where and how to start a transformation: with an app. The company has partnered with Pivotal to develop and build an on-demand grocery delivery application. Their app is focused: It will allow customers to browse, build, and purchase a basket of shopping items. In tandem, the Pivotal and client team built a &apos;picker&apos; app that will support the supermarket staff to pick, purchase, and improve on their next-day delivery service.



Speed of development and deployment was a critical element and top priority in order for this client to get ahead of the competition. The Pivotal team has helped this client build the app in a short period of time. We used the Pivotal Web Services &lt;[[https://run.pivotal.io/]]&gt; (PWS) platform to accelerate development, testing and delivery. Through a collaborative process that included user research, co-location and pair programming practices, we have empowered a core of their company&apos;s engineers and product developers with the skills to employ lean agile development on future projects.



This is a nice example of where we worked with a client by starting small to help an enterprise get a taste of a new development cycle through a service in which technology is fundamental to its success. Digital is being built into the heart and core of their organisation—not just bolting it on as a &apos;nice-to-have&apos; afterthought. We think this will lead to larger opportunities for them and for us—and we&apos;ll be sure to report back.

In the Berlin office, seating with teams that have fun while creating great things.
Just wrapped up a Discovery and Framing for Volkswagen&apos;s project, guiding product decisions through user research and designing cooperatively and collaboratively.
I like to read, watch movies, and visit exhibitions. I love to discover and listen to music and draw illustrations full of lines and dots that are mostly graphic representations of my childhood in Venezuela.
Is that I love plants, birds, and clouds (well, maybe clouds is not such a surprising love as a Pivotal employee).
Fresh air for the industry and I am happy to be part of their mission transforming how the world builds software.
