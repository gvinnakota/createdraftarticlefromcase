UP AND RUNNING WITH SPRING BOOT IN NETBEANS IDE
Guest Speaker: Geertjan Wielenga, Principal Product Manager, Oracle

NetBeans IDE is the official IDE of the Java platform. Focused on rapid out-of-the-box development of all kinds of Java applications, NetBeans is comprehensive and easy to use. In particular, its free and open source tooling for end-to-end development is much admired.

Over recent years, many developers have added NetBeans to their toolbox because of its intuitive and powerful integration with Maven and Gradle. During this session you will see how NetBeans is well suited for setting up and developing applications that make use of Spring Boot.

You will also learn about the many new features that have been added in NetBeans IDE 8.0 and 8.1, helping you working quickly and effectively with Java and Maven in the context of Spring Boot. By the end of this session, you&apos;ll have a better grasp of Spring Boot, as well as a thorough understanding of the range of features that NetBeans provides for working with it!
