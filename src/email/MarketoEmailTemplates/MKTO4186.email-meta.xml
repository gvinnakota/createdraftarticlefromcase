    <subject>Take microservices to the next level with NetflixOSS and Spring Cloud</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

We invite you to download a free copy of our new white paper: Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: Supercharging Your Microservices With NetflixOSS and Spring Cloud &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/supercharging-your-microservices-with-netflixoss-and-spring-cloud]]&gt;. 

 Netflix built an arsenal of technology to run one of the most sophisticated distributed systems in the world. They did so, in part, because the existing technology wasn’t suitable for their then-uncommon needs. 

 Fast-forward to today where developers at companies of all sizes are delivering global services with traffic that would have been unheard of just a few short years ago. Instead of reinventing the wheel and absorbing unsustainable complexity to deliver these services, smart teams have embraced the NetflixOSS stack, as delivered through Spring Cloud. 

 In this white paper, we’ll take a look at the architectural challenges Netflix faced, what they’ve released as open-source software, why this software matters to you, and how Pivotal makes it easy to consume Netflix software as part of Spring Cloud.

 Enjoy!
