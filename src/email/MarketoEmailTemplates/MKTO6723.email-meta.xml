In today&apos;s enterprise, the CIO has a lot of choice about how and where they run their applications. With all the hype about moving to the cloud, the reality is that a large percentage of enterprise workloads still run on-premises due to technical complexity, data privacy, and security concerns.

Join us on this webinar as we discuss:
- Choosing the right runtime for your workload
- Understanding the layers of application abstraction
- Introducing Pivotal Cloud Foundry

Featured Speakers:
- David Kari, Senior Manager of Platform Architecture ANZ, Pivotal
- Pas Apicella, Advisory Platform Architect APJ, Pivotal

We look forward to seeing you there.

Regards,

Lionel Lim
Vice President and Managing Director, Asia Pacific &amp; Japan
