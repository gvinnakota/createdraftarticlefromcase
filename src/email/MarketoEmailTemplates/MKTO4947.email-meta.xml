The 2,560 post-its that cover the 4th-floor entrance to Pivotal San Francisco is an organized riot of color that exclaims, in no uncertain terms, that Pivotal aims for inclusion (the rainbow array, incidentally, approximates the number of folks that Pivotal employs). I have no special claim on Pride month. But like many, I find company in its animating spirit to evolve mindsets and create a wider understanding of inclusion. While not unique to Pivotal, the company has a genuine strength and powerful tool in its value of empathy.
 

 
That empathy extends to client work. Many customers set goals to operate at runtime speeds and evolve to cloud-native architectures, and they just as often signal for help in their organizational march to attain them. In &quot;All Things Product&quot;, John Funk touches on this in his excellent introduction to the Platform Acceleration Lab—or PAL. Designed and run by Pivotal architects and engineers, the PAL aims primarily to help partners help our customers succeed with Pivotal technology. In &quot;Labs+Culture&quot;, Sydney&apos;s Nicola Rushton—who first introduced Postfacto here back in October—updates us on what&apos;s next for the retro app and beach project that has since gained an army of users within and outside of Pivotal.
 
It takes courage to share experiences that bring about mutual understanding. If you have a personal experience and story that you think will take us further along that path, and you&apos;re ready to share it, the D&amp;I team is giving you the opportunity to join that conversation &lt;[[https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeGSHdG-Ig9j7_7Tz4NoNWEetlXJqLNk7ZHpqRZxfHdsFQs3A/viewform]]&gt;.
partners find a friend in PAL 




John Funk &lt;[[#author-socialcast-profile]]&gt;, Partner Solutions Architect
Accenture, Cognizant, Capgemini, and other global system integrators have built their expertise around helping customers maximize the value of their IT strategies and investments. As Pivotal expands its software ecosystem to include these partners to help our customers become more successful with Pivotal software, we offer a powerful new way to help them.
 
Spun up by Pivotal architects and consultants in Boulder, CO, in October of 2016, the Platform 
Acceleration Lab (PAL) is an instructor-led, intensive training run by Pivotal developers and solutions architects to teach other developers and architects how to build modern applications and distributed systems on Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). 
 
The code-intensive, month-long training features courses and best practices designed for developers and architects from the likes of Accenture, Cognizant, and Pivotal customers who are new to cloud-native architectures. The goal is to help partners (and customers) gain quicker traction, and be more successful with customers who are adopting Pivotal technology. 
 
PAL has helped partners feel confident in their ability to help customers succeed with PCF at 
scale—confidence that ultimately helps them consume more PCF. In this way PAL is now one of the the first steps in a customer&apos;s application journey.


A cloud-native framework the Pivotal Way
 
The hands-on curriculum follows a logical progression in establishing a modern, cloud-native software shop: developing new applications, migrating existing applications (replatforming) and modernizing applications on PCF. It includes modules on PCF; modern cloud-native development; end-state reference architectures; replatforming; modernization. The program currently targets the Java crowd, while courses for .NET will be available later this year.
 
PAL also exposes students to Pivotal’s core methodology for software development, such as test-driven development, continuous integration and deployment, pairing, standups, and retrospectives. Participants leave with a certificate signifying that they&apos;ve completed the highest level of training Pivotal offers
 
Don&apos;t take it from us, really...
 
Here&apos;s what some of our PAL fellow travelers from Cognizent, HCL, CapGemini, and others have said:
 
“So many of the technical workshops simply skim over major concepts, our PAL instructors did not.” 
 
&quot;Our understanding of the modern day development has completely changed in the course of the program”. 
 
“I strongly believe this training will help us to build the right mix of people to expand the practice in HCL over the next few 
weeks/months.”
 
&quot;I&apos;ve already started to use some of the strategies and concepts in upcoming RFP’s and POC for our clients. I came away from the workshop feeling so confident.&quot;





Three cohorts of 48 engineers have graduated from the program, and more than half of them are engaged in cloud-native PCF projects for Pivotal customers. The notable increase in their engagement with Pivotal customers is a signal that PAL is becoming an important factor in our customers&apos; ability to transition to and expand their consumption of PCF.

postfacto 9 months on: 2000 weekly users!




Nicola Rushton &lt;[[#author-socialcast-profile]]&gt;, Product Designer, Sydney
In lots of Pivotal offices around the world, come Friday afternoon you’ll see a familiar tricolor flag flying in meeting rooms (often complemented by spirits), peeking out behind blinds and through doors. Retro time!
 

 
We started designing and building Postfacto &lt;[[https://postfacto.io]]&gt; in late August 2016 as a beach project in the Sydney office, working in a balanced team the way we ask our clients to. It speaks to the success of this process and the CI/CD technologies we use that we were able to use Postfacto to run our own retro in week 1 of the project.
 
Steady Growth
 
We’re now nine months in, and have 2,000 weekly active users that are customers and Pivots alike. Over 14,000 retro items are being created every month, with 12,000 of those being marked as done. Our users seem to be making lots of incremental improvements to the way their teams are working too. Around 2,900 action items are being created every month, with 2,500 being ticked off. We’re seeing steady growth—new retros are being created weekly, and we have surpassed 3,000 total retros. CoreLogic, Telstra, Ford, Penske, Boeing, Home Depot, Ebay, Disney, Thoughtworks, and more, are all doing retros the Postfacto way. 
 


 
iOS/Android react native app for facilitators
 
We&apos;re also pleased to announce the brand new native iOS/Android Postfacto app for facilitators! With just your phone, facilitators can now control the retro onscreen, swipe through items, and add action items. Shout out to the Toronto office, who did an amazing job of implementing the app in React Native. If you want to get it, Andrew Leung, our anchor in Toronto can hook you up with beta access.
 
Communicating better and an equal voice for all
 
Our research shows us that retros run with Postfacto are vastly more likely to get through all of their retro items. As a product team, we have a strong philosophy that the team should try to talk about everything on the board—it sends the message to the team that everyone’s thoughts are equally important. We believe if it’s important enough for someone to write in retro then it shouldn’t be left unaddressed.
 

 
What&apos;s next for Postfacto?
 
As more folks adopt Postfacto, we’ve had requests for features and support, and we have many ideas for ways to make it better. We built Postfacto on the beach (thank you Labs Sydney, Singapore, Toronto, and London) and now most of us are busy billing. We’re working on ways to sustain Postfacto so we can all make the most of it. Let us know if you think you can help. You can reach us by emailing postfacto@pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:postfacto@pivotal.io]]&gt;.

Labs Product Manager, London
At Pivotal I...
Work as a PM in the London Labs 
team.
You can find me...
In discussion with my team in the London office or in the Rijkswaterstaat &lt;[[https://www.rijkswaterstaat.nl/english]]&gt; building in Utrecht in the Netherlands. If not there, I&apos;m probably scoping out the snacks. I&apos;ve been instructed by my Dutch colleague to make it clear that the Netherlands is typically known as Holland, but that is incorrect as it is only region in the Netherlands… the more you know...
Currently, I&apos;m working on…

An infrastructure management project for Rijkswaterstaat, a department of the Dutch Government. We&apos;ve been working for 6-plus months to build an application that will help the Netherlands better manage data on all their roads, bridges, waterways, canals—and replace the 186 systems (at last count) currently used for this task. It&apos;s been a little bit of challenge but these things are enjoyable when you have a great team—we which we do.

 

In my spare time…
I primarily do three things—watch Arsenal &lt;[[http://www.arsenal.com/]]&gt; football, buy records, and make music. I&apos;m a part season ticket holder at Arsenal for my sins and I wouldn&apos;t have it any other way. Buying records became a habit when I started to chop up samples about a decade ago—now it&apos;s grown into a love for all sorts of weird records and DJing. I&apos;m also a drummer when I can find the time.
Something you probably don’t know about me…
I&apos;m quite talkative, so I&apos;m not sure there&apos;s not much Pivots don&apos;t know, but once upon a time I was a producer for an American/Japanese hip-hop group made up of US Army kids based in Okinawa—thanks Myspace. I also just started a group to make electronic music (mostly in my living room), but that&apos;s another story.
Vinyl vibes: in Papa&apos;s living room with friends; peace out with nephew Kairo.
To me Pivotal…
A great place to challenge yourself, and be part of a group people that can inspire you to do more. That may sound super cheesy, but in my case, it&apos;s also true.</textOnly>
