Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Thank you for attending Pivotal&apos;s Cloud Native Journey Webinar this week. Here&apos;s a quick recap: 


 - We looked at the common patterns that distinguish cloud native companies and the architectures that they employ.
 - We discovered that an opinionated platform, one that stretches from the infrastructure all the way to the application framework, rather than ad-hoc automation, is an essential component to an enterprise&apos;s cloud native journey.
 - We showed that the combination of Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Spring is the complete cloud native platform.
