<body ><div ><div class="mktEditable" id="edit_text_1" ><p>Team,<br /><br />In March, we asked all of you to help us manage our travel (T&amp;E) expenses, which was roughly $30M dollars in 2015. We emphasized that we did not want to halt activities strategic to our business that required travel&mdash;instances that helped us execute, grow, or close business. But we also made it clear how we needed to do a lot better in reducing T&amp;E for non-revenue generating expenses that we could manage just as well without incurring travel costs.<br /><br />At our last Town Hall meeting, Rob stressed the need to be frugal with our resources, and how an eventual IPO requires us to be on a road to profitability, where financial discipline is an imperative to remain on course.<br /><br />Unfortunately as of the close of Q2, we have NOT made significant progress in reducing our T&amp;E spend. We need to focus on three areas that continue to be problematic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel that is <u>NOT</u> revenue-generating, customer-facing, or customer delivery-related (e.g. Pivotal Labs) remains high. This includes non-essential travel for internal meetings;</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Too many Pivotal representatives traveling to customer meetings, which is defined by more than two Pivotal employees traveling to the same meeting. Note, we can have additional Pivotal representatives attend meetings via telephone or Google Hangout;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Finally, </span><u><span>NOT</span></u><span> following basic T&amp;E policy such as booking domestic and international travel at least 10 and 21 days in advance, respectively. So far, in 2016, nearly 60% of all air travel has been booked five days or less in advance.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The </span><span>leadership team will be closely tracking our T&amp;E spend for the remainder of the year. Monthly T&amp;E reports listing all travelers will be reviewed in detail, and leaders and managers will be held accountable. Moreover, to ensure compliance with </span><strong><a style="color: #059a91; text-decoration: none;" href="https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/departments/finance/travel-expense-t-e"><span>T&amp;E policies</span></a></strong><span>, weekly travel booking reports will flag reservations that are outside of policy&mdash;allowing leaders and managers to stop trips before they occur.<br /><br /></span>To ensure Pivotal has a strong financial foundation to build on our growth momentum, we need everyone to pitch in and deliver a better result in Q3 and Q4. Your respective business leaders will provide more prescriptive actions in a follow-up communication.<br /><br />Thank you for making this a priority.</p>
