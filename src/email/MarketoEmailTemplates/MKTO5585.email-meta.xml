    <subject>1/17/18 Webinar: Domain Events &amp; Event Storming Part Four</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar, Domain Events &amp; Event Storming Part Four &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/jan-17-domain-events-event-storming-part-four-webinar?utm_source=digest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=ddd-part4-Q118]]&gt; on January 17, 2018. 

In the fourth part of our Domain-Driven Design (DDD) webinar series we address Domain Events, a major driver for the evolution of DDD over the last couple of years. 

Domain Events help us to decouple Bounded Contexts by interaction through preferably asynchronous business events. Domain Events can also be used as a persistence model (Event Sourcing). In order to identify suitable Domain Events, Alberto Brandolini invented a new workshop format called, Event Storming. 

This webinar introduces you to the concept of Domain Events and explains how you can leverage the advantages of this approach in your software architectures. We will also address common pitfalls and trade-offs when working with Domain Events and will take a close look at Event Storming and its benefits.

Presenter: Michael Plöd, Principal Consultant, InnoQ
