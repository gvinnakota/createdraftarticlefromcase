    <subject>Important Announcement Regarding Travel at Pivotal</subject>
    <textOnly>All, 
I mentioned at Town Hall that one of our top company priorities is achieving greater autonomy in how we operate, which puts us on a path to becoming a self-sustaining, independent company. As a result, and over the course of the past year, we brought a number of operations formerly administered by Dell/EMC under Pivotal&apos;s control—e.g., Pivotal’s benefits and payroll programs.
