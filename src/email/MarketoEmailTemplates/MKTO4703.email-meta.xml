    <textOnly>Pivotal is pleased to host our third Transformation Council Workshop led by Eric Ries, author of The Lean Startup, The Leader’s Guide and soon to be published, The Startup Way. We invite you to join us on May 1-2 in San Francisco for this exclusive event. 

 Pivotal’s Transformation Council is an invite-only community for enterprise executives who are driving digital transformation within their organization. The purpose of the council is to create a trusted forum where executives can regularly come together to learn, exchange ideas, and share their organizational experiences with one another.  

The two-day event will kick off with a private dinner at One Market &lt;[[http://onemarket.com/]]&gt;, followed by a half-day of discussions and workshop. The workshop theme is “Failure is not an option, it’s necessary to transform.&quot;
