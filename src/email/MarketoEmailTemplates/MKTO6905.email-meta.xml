BEST PRACTICE OF THE MONTH: 
Submitting talks for CF Summit North America


The call for proposals closes on November 30th &lt;[[https://www.cloudfoundry.org/event_subpages/cfna-2019-cfp/]]&gt;! This is a great way to showcase your expertise to the Cloud Foundry community. Here are helpful tips for submitting:



	- Share the stage with a customer! Having an end user as part of your talk will increase the likelihood of it’s acceptance.
	- Pay close attention to the categories. Make sure your talk clearly fits with the category you are submitting to. You may have to tweak your story a bit to make it fit!
	- Craft a strong headline! A track name that stands out helps not only to get your talk accepted, but then also to get people in the room! Put some numbers in there, make it memorable!
