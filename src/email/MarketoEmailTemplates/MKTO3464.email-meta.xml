    <subject>You are Invited: SpringOne Platform</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=There}},
 
 We invite you to join Pivotal in transforming how the world builds software at the Aria in Las Vegas on August 1–4 for SpringOne Platform. &lt;[[http://springoneplatform.io/?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=springone-platform-2016]]&gt;
 

 If you want to build software that delivers differentiated value to your organization better and faster (and who doesn&apos;t), then you won’t want to miss this event. SpringOne Platform is a unique event where top industry developers, operators, architects, product managers, data scientists, and executives gather for in-depth conversations on the current and future impact of transformative software in our lives—consumer, enterprise, and government. 
 
 This is the premier cloud native Java conference of the year, but we’ll also share insights from helping organizations leverage modern tools and processes that are transforming their businesses. Microservices, devops, continuous delivery, lean design, agile, anything to do with building better software—and building software better—will be on the program. Not to mention, there will be workshops and training covering Pivotal technology: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Cloud Foundry, Big Data—we’ll have everything needed to deliver software but you. 

 If you have a software story to share with the world, we would love to have you propose a session &lt;[[http://springoneplatform.io/submit?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=springone-platform-2016]]&gt; (Call-for-Papers is open until March 24th). For partners that want to work with us, sponsorship opportunities &lt;[[https://d1ophd2rlqbanb.cloudfront.net/SpringOnePlatform_PROSPECTUS.pdf]]&gt; are available now. 

 Mark your calendar, tell all your friends, and watch this space for further updates. Registration will open in the next few weeks and we’ll be announcing keynotes, sessions and extra curricular activities as we go. 
 
 See you there!
 The SpringOne Platform Team at Pivotal
