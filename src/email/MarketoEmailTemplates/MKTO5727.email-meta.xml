    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar, Pivotal Cloud Foundry 2.1: Making Transformation Real &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/mar-22-pivotal-cloud-foundry-2-1-making-transformation-real-webinar?utm_source=digest&amp;utm_medium=webinars&amp;utm_campaign=pcf2.1&amp;utm_term=q218]]&gt;, on March 22, 2018. 

The Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) platform has expanded and now includes a family of products to rapidly deliver apps, containers and functions. This evolution reflects today&apos;s IT reality — you need to use the right abstraction for each scenario. 

Join us for a discussion of PCF 2.1: the first release that includes updates to the PCF family: Pivotal Application Service (PAS), Pivotal Container Service (PKS), Pivotal Function Service (PFS), and the Services Marketplace. 

PCF 2.1 release highlights include: PAS for Windows, PKS 1.0, Steeltoe 2.0, Spring Cloud Data Flow for PCF 1.0, and much more. We&apos;ll also discuss a slew of highlights to PAS, including essential enhancements to Operations Manager, security, routing, and built-in services. 

Presenters: 
Jared Ruckle, Pivotal 
Pieter Humphrey, Pivotal
