Sales Play Rollout
Many of you have now heard about &quot;the Play,&quot; which is Pivotal’s latest and most effective approach to selling Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Content has been put together that is based on a sales process that was tried and refined over the last 6 months in the trenches at Verizon, Comcast, Dish Network and many, many other accounts. On the PCF Sales Play &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal-cf/pcf-sales-plays&gt; site, you will find a series of assets to help you execute the play. Assume this content will evolve as we collectively learn more about our customers, their needs and the best way to communicate the value of our products and services.

Product Updates
Reminder: Big Data Suite, Flex Hadoop Edition
If your customer already has Hortonworks HDP and does not require Pivotal Hadoop distribution (PHD), then sell your customer Pivotal Big Data Suite, 
Flex Hadoop Edition.Flex Hadoop Edition includes the same entitlements as the standard BDS, but without PHD. The Flex Hadoop Edition has been specifically designed for customers who are using a non-Pivotal Hadoop distribution, such as Hortonworks. Selling PHD in this case would be duplication and would add unnecessary costs to Pivotal.

HAWQ and MADlib OSS

In addition, the commercial version of HAWQ has been renamed to “Pivotal HDB” and will continue to be provided and supported through Pivotal Big Data Suite. We will update the various systems and tools (MPL, Product Guide, SKUs, Zendesk, etc) very soon.
