    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Why do companies like Amazon, Netflix, Stripe, and Uber value software more than any other corporate asset? Because they understand that software is the vehicle that drives digital business. It allows them to deliver unique experiences for their customers, it automates processes, and it enables them to assess and access new platforms, frameworks and systems that will speed the prototyping and testing of new ideas. 


We all know the software driving digital business “doesn&apos;t magically appear — it&apos;s written by developers.”&apos;

In “Digital Transformation 
Requires Development Transformation &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/analyst-reports/digital-transformation-requires-development-transformation?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=dev-trans-forrester-q119]]&gt;,” Forrester Research defines the best practices that application development and delivery (AD&amp;D) leaders can implement to improve their chances of successful digital transformation. The report identifies four pillars of digital business and why they matter, and focuses on six levers that app devs can deploy for a successful transformation: culture, talent, metrics, process and technology. 
Regardless of where you are on your journey, this report will help you clearly define the areas to focus on, and validate the initiatives you may have already started. Read it today &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/analyst-reports/digital-transformation-requires-development-transformation?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=dev-trans-forrester-q119]]&gt; and then let us know &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/contact?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=dev-trans-forrester-q119]]&gt; how we can help!
