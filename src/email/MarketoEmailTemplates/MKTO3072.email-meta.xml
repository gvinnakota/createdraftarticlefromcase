Hello,

When I co-founded Greenplum over a decade ago, my goal was to simplify the challenge of business intelligence processing and advanced data analytics. We set out to do incredible and unimaginable things with data.

The stories from many of our Greenplum Database customers inspire me and I wanted to share some exciting news with you.

Pivotal is making Greenplum Database available as an open source offering to the 
community. Open Source Software (OSS) is an incredible driver for innovation. Digital-focused companies deploying OSS are rapidly innovating and threatening leadership positions of many large, traditional enterprises. The next generation of customers is increasingly demanding new and better ways to interact with vendors. It is a brave new world, in which most of the winners are powered by OSS.

Pivotal can now simplify your data challenges even further and we want to show you firsthand. Together with our field engineering and data science teams, weâ€™d like to offer to run a Data Innovation Workshop and discover ways that we can help transform how you build software, improve performance and use data to become a digital business.

Thank you for your support. I hope you will take advantage of this unique opportunity by visiting this page &lt;http://pivotal.io/data-innovation?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=ignite-install-base-q415&gt; and look forward to 
ensuring that Pivotal continues to be an important partner in your success.


Best Regards,

Scott Yara
