    <subject>2/13/19 Webinar - Ten Reasons Why Netezza Professionals Should Consider Greenplum</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar Ten Reasons Why Netezza Professionals Should Consider Greenplum &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/feb-13-ten-reasons-why-netezza-professionals-should-consider-greenplum-webinar?utm_source=promo&amp;utm_medium=webinar&amp;utm_campaign=netezza-greenplum&amp;utm_term=q119]]&gt;, on February 13, 2019. 

This webinar is for IT professionals who have devoted considerable time and effort growing their careers in and around the Netezza platform. 

We’ll explore the architectural similarities and technical specifics of what makes the open source Greenplum Database a logical next step for those IT professionals wishing to leverage their MPP experience with a PostgreSQL-based database. 

As the Netezza DBMS faces a significant end-of-support milestone, leveraging an open source, infrastructure-agnostic replacement that has a similar architecture will help avoid a costly migration to either a different architecture or another proprietary alternative.
