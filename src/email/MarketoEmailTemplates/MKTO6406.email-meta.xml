    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar The Accelerate State of DevOps Report &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/oct-11-the-accelerate-state-of-devops-report-webinar?utm_source=promo&amp;utm_medium=webinar&amp;utm_campaign=dora-forsgren-seroter&amp;utm_term=q418]]&gt;, on October 11, 2018. 

The Accelerate State of DevOps Report is the result of five years of research—with over 30,000 data 
points—to understand high performance in the context of software development, and the factors that predict it. 

In this webinar, we discuss the key findings in the 2018 report. Join us to learn how:


	- 
Software delivery performance unlocks several competitive advantages including increased profitability, productivity, 
market share, customer service, and ability to achieve organization or mission goals

	- 
Not just using cloud infrastructure, but implementing cloud as it’s intended to be used, contributes to high 
performance

	- 
Outsourcing may save money in the short term, but is much more likely to contribute to low performance

	- 
Identifying key technological practices can drive high performance across your organization (and evidence that industry 
vertical doesn’t matter)

Dr. Nicole Forsgren, CEO, DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)
Richard Seroter, Sr. Director of Product, Pivotal

Date: Thursday, October 11, 2018
