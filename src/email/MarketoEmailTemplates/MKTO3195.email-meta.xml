    <textOnly>Colleagues,

I want to give you an update, and provide guidance on our 2016 Kickoff Celebrations. We’re taking the same approach as last year. Instead of having holiday parties at the end of this year, we’ll be holding regional kickoff celebrations in early 2016, leading up to the Pivotal Worldwide Kickoff event that will be held in San Francisco the week of January 25th.

The budgets have been set, and leads in each region will be arranging these celebrations. Details will be available in the coming weeks.

Looking forward to seeing you all at the Town Hall this week.

Thank you,

Joe</textOnly>
