    <subject>10/25 Continuous Delivery: Fly the Friendly CI in Pivotal Cloud Foundry with Concourse</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/oct-25-continuous-delivery-fly-the-friendly-ci-in-pivotal-cloud-foundry-with-concourse?utm_source=digest&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=concourse-pcf-2-q417]]&gt; for the webinar, Continuous Delivery: Fly the Friendly CI in Pivotal Cloud Foundry with Concourse &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/oct-25-continuous-delivery-fly-the-friendly-ci-in-pivotal-cloud-foundry-with-concourse?utm_source=digest&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=concourse-pcf-2-q417]]&gt;, on October 25, 2017. 

Concourse is an open source continuous integration (CI) system designed for agile development teams. It supports developers that priactice test-driven development and continuous delivery (CD) by automating a teams build-to-release process inclusive of all automated testing.

Concourse provides dependable results for each build run. It allows agile development teams to deliver business value at a much higher velocity. It allows teams to treat every code commit as if it&apos;s about to be deployed to production. 


In this webinar we’ll talk about how teams&apos; practice agile development in relation to developing, testing and 
deploying apps in Cloud Foundry. We&apos;ll also cover the role that Concourse plays in aiding high velocity delivery of applications.

Our agenda includes:


	- 
What is CI / CD and how do these practices fit into Pivotal&apos;s development practices

	- 
Overview of Concourse and how it differs from other CI / CD systems

	- 
Why Pipelines are useful for continuously delivering apps to Pivotal Cloud Foundry

	- 
Why containers are useful for continuously delivering apps to Pivotal Cloud Foundry

	- 
Example os how these concepts work in practice

	- How to get started using Concourse to continuously deliver value
