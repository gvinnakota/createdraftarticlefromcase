    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar How to Use Containers to Simplify Speedy Deployment of Database 
Workloads &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/nov-14-how-to-use-containers-to-simplify-speedy-deployment-of-database-workloads-webinar?utm_source=promo&amp;utm_medium=webinar&amp;utm_campaign=containers-db-redmonk&amp;utm_term=q418]]&gt;, on November 14, 2018. 

Containers have been widely adopted to make development and testing faster, and are now used at enterprise scale for stateless applications in production. Database infrastructure has not seen quite the same gains in terms of velocity over that same period, however. 

Can containers be as transformative for databases as they have been for application development? If container technology can be leveraged for running database workloads, what impact does this have on architects and operations teams that are responsible for running databases? 

We’ll discuss the trends—from virtualization to cloud to containerization—and 
the intersection of these platform trends with the data-driven world.
