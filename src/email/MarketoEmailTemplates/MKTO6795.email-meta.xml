    <subject>12/6 Webinar: End-to-End Reactive Data Access Using R2DBC with RSocket and Proteus</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar End-to-End Reactive Data Access Using R2DBC with RSocket and Proteus &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/dec-6-end-to-end-reactive-data-access-using-r2dbc-with-rsocket-and-proteus-webinar?utm_source=promo&amp;utm_medium=webinar&amp;utm_campaign=rsocket-proteus-netifi&amp;utm_term=q418]]&gt;, on 
December 6, 2018. 

Lack of asynchronous relational database drivers in Java has been a barrier to writing scalable, data-driven applications for many. R2DBC is seeking to change this with a new API designed from the ground up for reactive programming against relational databases—its intent ito support reactive data access built on natively asynchronous, non-blocking SQL database drivers. 

How does this change the game for data access in the cloud? Used in conjunction with RSocket and Proteus, it is now possible to write applications benefiting from reactive streaming end-to-end, from the browser all the way to the database. No more fiddling with paging APIs, polling for updates, or writing complex logic to merge data from multiple sources--reactive streams can handle this all for you! 

RSocket is an open-source, reactive networking protocol that is a collaborative development initiative of Netifi with Pivotal, Facebook, and others. Proteus is a freely available broker for RSocket that is designed to handle the challenges of communication between complex networks of services—both within the data center and over the internet—extending to mobile devices and browsers. 

Attend this webinar to learn how to use Pivotal Cloud Foundry with R2DBC and Proteus to build reactive microservices that return large amounts of data in a streaming fashion over RSocket.
