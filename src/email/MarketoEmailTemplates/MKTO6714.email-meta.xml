    <subject>This Month in Spring</subject>
    <textOnly>November 2018
Hi Spring fans, and welcome to another installment of This Month in Spring! As I write this, I&apos;m in the last stretch of the year, concluding as many visits with as many people as possible. I&apos;ve just arrived in Beijing. I was just in St. Petersburg, Russia; San Francisco and Hartford, USA; and Paris—but I&apos;ve got many miles to go before I sleep, sometime in December! I&apos;ll be visiting communities and customers in (no particular order): Tokyo, Milan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taipei, Seoul, Los Angeles, Zurich, Toronto, and Seattle. We&apos;ll see if anything else, ahem, springs up! If you&apos;re going to be in any of these places, as always, don&apos;t hesitate to say hello &lt;[[https://twitter.com/Starbuxman]]&gt;! (Or, if you use WeChat, you can find my WeChat barcode on my About page &lt;[[http://joshlong.com/about.html]]&gt;.)


I&apos;m trying to keep busy, but it seems no matter how much I try, I can&apos;t outpace the incredible, bombastic Spring community! Time sure flies! Can you believe we&apos;re already staring down 2019? Let&apos;s see what&apos;s happened in the last 30-ish days!

it &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/cloud-native-josh-long/this-month-in-spring-november-1-2018?utm_source=spring-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=spring-newsletter-november-2018]]&gt;

Is Your Organization Software Driven?


The Built to Adapt Benchmark is a quantitative framework of indicators that gauges how well an organization builds, deploys, and operates software. Pivotal collaborated with Longitude Research and Ovum to assess the world’s top organizations with more than 1,600 respondents across six countries and five industries. The research explores how organizations align their product development and IT operations with business goals to build software that delivers desirable outcomes.
