March 2019
Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Month in Spring!



It&apos;s shaping up to be quite the month indeed. I just returned from the epic SpringOne Tour event in Columbus, OH, and now I&apos;m on a jet winging my way to Tel Aviv, Israel. I&apos;ll be speaking at the local Java User Group &lt;[[https://eventil.com/events/special-guest-reactive-spring-with-josh-long]]&gt; and meeting customers while I&apos;m there. Then I&apos;ve got a few live training events that you can still sign up for: the first is on using Kotlin with Spring &lt;[[https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/spring-boot-and-kotlin/0636920241393/]]&gt; and the second is on testing with Spring &lt;[[https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/bootiful-testing/0636920241447/]]&gt;. After that, it&apos;s off to Atlanta for the seminal DevNexus conference, where I&apos;ll have the honor of presenting with the good Dr. Venkat Subramaniam on all things Kotlin—don&apos;t miss this!

Then I’ll be in Seattle for the Seattle Java User Group &lt;[[https://www.meetup.com/seajug/events/259287945/]]&gt;, before heading to beautiful Montreal for the amazing Confoo show, where I&apos;ll be talking about testing Spring applications &lt;[[https://confoo.ca/en/yul2019/session/bootiful-testing]]&gt;. From there, I’ll go to the SpringOne Tour London &lt;[[https://springonetour.io/2019/london?utm_source=spring-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=spring-newsletter-march-2019]]&gt; and Amsterdam stops &lt;[[https://springonetour.io/2019/amsterdam?utm_source=spring-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=spring-newsletter-march-2019]]&gt;. I&apos;ve got a few customer visits after that, and then I’m off to the Kafka Summit in New York City, where I&apos;ll be speaking with the legendary Tim Berglund &lt;[[https://twitter.com/tlberglund]]&gt; on all things Kafka and streaming with Kafka and Spring. I&apos;d love to see you there at each of these events! Sign up, subscribe, set a reminder, book a flight, and of course: don&apos;t hesitate to say hello on Twitter &lt;[[https://twitter.com/starbuxman]]&gt;.
