    <subject>5/31 Webinar: How to Capitalize on Social Media Analytics using Data Science</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Determining individual customer desire or intent from social media data provides companies, particularly consumer-facing companies, the opportunity to deliver targeted, more effective messaging and convert more sales. 

 In some cases, the job is fairly easy. If someone tweets that she really enjoyed riding in a friend’s Tesla, for example, it’s pretty clear this person is more likely to respond to a targeted offer for an electric car than someone who tweets that they hate Teslas. 

 But in many cases, discerning and capitalizing on customer desire and intent is more challenging. It requires confirming relevance, intent and sentiment, and matching customers with available inventory.
