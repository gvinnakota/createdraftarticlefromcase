RECORDED SESSIONS - EARLY ACCESS 
We are filming all SpringOne tracks, and the vast majority of the 2GX tracks (only a few sessions from the G&amp;G special topics track that won’t be filmed) and publishing them in HD for registered attendees within days after the conference. Now you can see any sessions you missed! Videos will also become freely available 3-4/week for non-SpringOne2GX 2015 attendees over the next 6 months, but as attendees you get instant access much sooner. A separate email on Monday Sept 14th will be sent with your access code and more details.

It’s going to be an incredible event. You are one of the lucky ones who gets to go to conferences. Enjoy it and we’ll make sure you get the goods to bring it back for your team!

Sincerely, 
The Spring Team at Pivotal, and the No Fluff Just Stuff team</textOnly>
