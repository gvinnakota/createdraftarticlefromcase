technology company.
 </span><br><br><span>For Pivotal, our mission and strategy remains the same - we transform how the world builds software.
             After the transaction closes, we will have the support of an even stronger corporate structure that will continue enabling us to operate as a fast-moving start-up with the intent to go public at the appropriate time.
 </span><br><br><span>We need to remain focused on moving full speed ahead.
             That means continue developing great technology, continue helping our customers on their digital transformation journeys, and continue winning key customer deals.</span><br><br><span>A <a style="color: #3ea7bc; text-decoration: none;" href="https://stream.emc.com/">live stream</a> 
of     the     EMC employee meeting can be viewed live at 7:30 A.M.
             (PST) from any connection worldwide.
             The event code is 42442654.<br><br><img src="http://connect.pivotal.io/rs/625-IUJ-009/images/rob-mee-sign-200x25.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="25"><br><br>------------------------</span><br><br><span><span>Message from Joe Tucci</span></span><br><br><span>I am     
excited to announce that Dell Inc.
        and EMC Corporation have signed a definitive agreement under which Dell, together with its owners, Michael S.
        Dell, founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Dell, MSD Partners and Silver Lake, the global leader in technology investing, will acquire EMC Corporation, while maintaining VMware as a publicly-traded company.
        Almost two years ago, the same partnership took Dell private, and we believe that by combining EMC and Dell we have an opportunity to create one of the world’s great technology companies.
        As part of this transaction, the new ownership structure will maintain VMware as an independent, publicly-traded company.
        The transaction will be subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and we expect to close in mid-2016.
        The press release posted online contains more details on the announcement.</span><br><br><span>Michael is joining us today for an employee meeting that we will hold at 10:30 am ET and live stream for viewing by all EMC Federation employees worldwide.
        (Viewing instructions to come separately.) Employees who cannot join live will be able to view a video recording of the meeting to be posted on internal websites.
        And later today, Michael and I will travel to Palo Alto to meet with VMware employees this afternoon.</span><br><br><span>We reached this decision because we are seeing unprecedented waves of change in our industry, and we believe that to navigate those changes we need to create a new  
     company  for a new era.
        I believe that this is the best course for our future.
        It is the path that gives us the best opportunity to emerge a winner in the new era, serve our customers well, preserve our partner relationships and realize full value for our shareholders.</span><br><br><span>The combination of EMC and Dell will create a world leader in the most      
attractive   high-growth segments of the $2 trillion global information technology market.
        Across the two companies, we have an amazing array of world class talent, a complementary, best-of-breed, portfolio and tremendous customers and partner relationships.
        Our strategically aligned capabilities across EMC Information Infrastructure, VMware, Pivotal — a fast moving startup with the intent to go public — and rapidly growing Virtustream, focused on managed cloud services for mission critical applications, will position the combined  
     company  very well.</span><br><br><span>Since going private two years ago, Dell has evolved its business to focus more on higher value enterprise offerings, complementing its strengths in the small business and mid-market.
        Together, we will cover the market more comprehensively, be more competitive, and be better able to attack the fastest growing areas of the industry: digital transformation, software-defined data center, hybrid cloud, converged infrastructure, mobile and security.
        The combined company’s privately-controlled ownership structure will give us the flexibility to invest for long-term results.
        That includes the ability to innovate, demonstrate technology leadership, continue to attract world-class talent and incubate high-growth businesses in the most promising segments to fuel profitable growth.</span><br><br><span>Until the transaction closes, I will continue in my role as 
       Chairman and CEO along with the leaders of our federation businesses.
        After closing, the new ownership structure will create a new Enterprise Systems Business, headquartered in Hopkinton, with expected annual revenues of more than $30 billion.
        While the transaction undergoes shareholder and regulatory review, we must continue to run our business with the same dedication and commitment that we show today.</span><br><br><span>There will be a lot more information in the coming days and months, but for now let me say that 
leading     our    business and working with all of you has been the most rewarding experience in my 46-year career in the technology industry.
        I am tremendously proud of everything we’ve built here – from our humble, startup beginnings to a global, world-class technology company driven by an unyielding dedication to our customers.
        I am absolutely confident that the combination of EMC and Dell will prove to be a winning combination for our customers, partners and, most importantly, for you — the smart and dedicated people who have made our companies truly great and some of the best places to work in the world.
        Thank you — to every one of you — for making this an incredible, ongoing journey for us all.</span><br><br><span>Joe Tucci</span><br><br><span>Disclosure Regarding Forward Looking Statements </span><br><br><span>This communication contains forward-looking
