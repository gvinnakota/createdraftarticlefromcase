    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 
We look forward to seeing you at the .NET Cloud-Native Bootcamp, hosted by Pivotal at EMC. As a reminder, this will be a full, fun day to learn about patterns and technology. We’ll take care of breakfast and lunch, so don’t worry about packing anything!
Please make sure that you’ve installed the Cloud Foundry CLI &lt;[[https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html#installer]]&gt; (versions exist for Windows, Mac, and Linux) on your laptop. Also, be sure to have a development environment handy, as we’ll be slinging some code together.
Pivotal will take care of providing the initial source code, and hosting environment. If you’d like to read up on Cloud Foundry &lt;[[http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-10/concepts/index.html]]&gt; and Steeltoe &lt;[[https://steeltoe.io/]]&gt;, feel free. But don’t worry, we’ll do an engaging deep dive together tomorrow.
