    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar Tools and Recipes to Replatform Monolithic Apps to Modern Cloud 
Environments &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/mar-21-tools-and-recipes-to-replatform-monolithic-apps-to-modern-cloud-environments-webinar?utm_source=promo1&amp;utm_medium=webinar&amp;utm_campaign=step-by-step-dtx-ibm&amp;utm_term=q119]]&gt;, on March 21, 2019. 

Digital transformation includes replatforming applications to streamline release cycles, improve availability, and manage apps and services at scale. But many enterprises are afraid to take the first step because they don’t know where to start. In this webinar, Rohit Kelapure from Pivotal, and Arthur De Magalhaes from our partner, IBM, will provide a step-by-step guide that covers: 


	- 
How to find high-value modernization projects within your application portfolio 

	- 
Easy tools and techniques to minimally change applications in preparation for replatforming 

	- 
How to choose the platform with the right level of abstraction for your app

	- 
Examples that show how Java EE Websphere applications can be deployed to Pivotal Cloud Foundry

	- 
In-depth functionality of the WebSphere Liberty app server in a container
