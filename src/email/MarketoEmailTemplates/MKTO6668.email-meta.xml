    <subject>Complimentary Forrester Report on Reducing Risk and Improving Security through Automation</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
We invite you to read Forrester’s Reduce Risk And Improve Security Through Infrastructure Automation &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/analyst-reports/reduce-risk-and-improve-security-through-infrastructure-automation?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=email-forrester-reduce-risk-q318]]&gt; report.

According to Forrester, today&apos;s security initiatives are impossible to execute manually. As infrastructure-as-code (IaC), edge computing, and internet-of-things (IoT) solutions proliferate, organizations must leverage automation to protect their business technology strategies. It can be tempting to continue the I&amp;O and security and risk processes that have seemingly worked for years...but doing so puts your business and customers at severe risk. Automation is a profoundly effective movement that will revolutionize I&amp;O professionals&apos; work.
Read this report and learn how infrastructure and operations (I&amp;O) and security professionals can deliver efficient 
risk management and compliance throughout the entire solution stack — with unprecedented speed, agility, and dependability.
