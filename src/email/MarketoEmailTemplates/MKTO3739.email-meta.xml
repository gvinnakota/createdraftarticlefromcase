Living on the Edge: Why Route Services Matter
Route Services in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) are a new type of marketplace service that developers insert into the request path for their application. These services intercept requests at the edge of PCF and help you to speed up development while consistently delivering more secure, robust applications. This week, Apigee, a graduate of the Pivotal Industry Day, launches a new route service for their API management tool, Apigee Edge.

Fail Fast and Ask More Questions of Your Data With HDB 2.0
Pivotal HDB 2.0, the Hadoop Native Database powered by Apache HAWQ (incubating), became generally available last week. This release marks a major milestone in the technology’s evolution from its massively parallel processing (MPP) roots towards a new category of cloud-scale analytical database, deeply integrated with the Apache Hadoop ecosystem. So, the technology is cool, but why does this really matter? In this post we’ll look at this release through the lens of digital transformation requirements.

Join Us for Cloud Foundry Industry Day in New York
We&apos;re delighted to announce Pivotal’s second Cloud Foundry Industry Day. (The event is first-come, first-serve, and we expect the limited spots to disappear quickly). For two full days, the members of Pivotal&apos;s Platform Engineering team will train, pair program, and debug with a few dozen software developers – live, and face-to-face. In short, we’ll get you into the Cloud Foundry marketplace.
