To keep pace with competition and drive innovation, organisations are increasingly learning to become software-driven companies; accelerating developer productivity, porting applications to the cloud, automating infrastructure and innovating with new software. While they support the business objectives of driving innovation and being agile, organisations often struggle to attain the practices, processes and technologies to support this transformation.

Join Pivotal for an executive breakfast with your industry peers as we discuss lessons learned at the cutting edge of software development in Australia and how to implement long-term transformation within your organisation. This event will also feature insights from the Build To Adapt Framework Report, an industry survey, created in partnership with Longitude and Ovum, that investigates the indicators for understanding how well organisations build software that delivers business value.

Featured Speakers:
- James Bligh, Co-Founder, RedCrew (former Senior Manager Commercial Feasibility at National Australia Bank)
- Roz Gregory, Director Customer Success &amp; Digital Transformation, APJ, Pivotal

We look forward to seeing you there.

Regards,

Lionel Lim
Vice President and Managing Director, Asia Pacific &amp; Japan
