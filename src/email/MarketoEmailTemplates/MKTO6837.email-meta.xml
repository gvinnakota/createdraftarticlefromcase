    <subject>This Month in Spring</subject>
    <textOnly>December 2018
Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another jam-packed This Month in Spring! Happy holidays to you and yours! It&apos;s also the busy end-of-conference season, with people all around the world getting in their last-minute learning before the new year—and, at least for some, before the training budgets run out!

I&apos;ve been keeping busy. Since we last talked a month ago, I&apos;ve been to Morocco, Switzerland, France, Italy, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Los Angeles, and possibly—though memory fails me—Connecticut. You know what&apos;s been common to all those visits? Amazing people! The most bootiful people in the world.

I&apos;ll be in Toronto and Seattle and then, I think, I&apos;ll be winding down for the year starting the middle of this month. But, not to worry: even if we can&apos;t meet in person until 2019, there&apos;s always more things and more Springs for the season. The first episode of the 5th season of Spring Tips &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTKlk8_9aAw&amp;list=PLgGXSWYM2FpPw8rV0tZoMiJYSCiLhPnOc]]&gt; just debuted on the Spring blog &lt;[[https://spring.io/blog]]&gt;, and 
will continue each Wednesday for the next 11 weeks. I&apos;ll of course be doing weekly installments of This Week in Spring—we’re going into our 8th year in the first week of January—which runs every Tuesday on the Spring blog as well. I&apos;ll also be working fast and furious on my new book, Reactive Spring &lt;[[http://www.reactivespring.io/]]&gt;, coming soon! And, finally, this month I&apos;ll be releasing the first episodes of a A Bootiful Podcast &lt;[[https://twitter.com/BootifulPodcast]]&gt;, a new podcast on which I&apos;ve long been toiling. You can find it—guess where—on the Spring blog! So: watch that space.

That&apos;s all from me! Let&apos;s get to the good stuff, the reason for the (Spring) season, all the great content from you and the ecosystems around Spring. And, there is a ton of content!
