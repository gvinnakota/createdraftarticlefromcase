    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar Application Migration: How to Start, Scale and Succeed, &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/sep-5-application-migration-how-to-start-scale-and-succeed-webinar?utm_source=promo&amp;utm_medium=webinar&amp;utm_campaign=apptx-seroter&amp;utm_term=q318]]&gt; on September 5, 2018. 

Undergoing the application migration journey can be cumbersome and challenging, especially when you have a complex application portfolio that consists of both legacy and newer apps on 
outdated systems. You are hindered by managing and operating manual processes to address security concerns, regulatory change and policy compliance.

We use simple tools and start small to redefine current systems, and achieve cloud-native speed and resiliency. Let us show you how Pivotal can help you navigate your journey while instilling confidence along the way.
