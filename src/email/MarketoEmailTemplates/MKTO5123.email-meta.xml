Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 
 Cloud computing ushered in a software renaissance and Spring has never been more relevant and in-demand. We’re rapidly advancing the framework—adding flexibility to the programming model for cloud-native, reactive, and functional workloads. 
 
We invite you to join developers from the New York area for a two-day community event where we will share presentations and participate in open discussions about all things Spring. Don’t miss this opportunity to learn from and share with members of the Spring community.

Cloud Native Streaming and Event-Driven Microservices
 Join us for an introduction to Spring Cloud Stream. See how Spring Cloud Stream’s abstractions and opinionated primitives allow you to easily build applications that can interchangeably use RabbitMQ, Kafka or Google PubSub without changing the application logic. Finally, we will show how these applications can be orchestrated and deployed on different modern runtimes.

Servlet vs Reactive Stacks In 5 Use Cases
 In the past year Netflix shared a story about upgrading their main gateway serving 83 million users from Servlet-stack Zuul 1 to an async and non-blocking Netty-based Zuul 2. The results were interesting and nuanced with some major benefits as well as some trade-offs. In this talk we&apos;ll take 5 common use cases in web application development and explore the impact of building on Servlet and Reactive web application stacks.
