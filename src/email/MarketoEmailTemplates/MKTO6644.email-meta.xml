    <subject>11/15 Webinar - Refactoring the Factory: Building a Cloud-Native App Transformation Factory</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=}},
 

Please join us for the webinar Refactoring the Factory: Building a Cloud-Native App Transformation Factory &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/nov-15-refactoring-the-factory-building-a-cloud-native-app-transformation-factory-webinar?utm_source=promo&amp;utm_medium=webinar&amp;utm_campaign=cgi-451-apptx&amp;utm_term=q418]]&gt;, on 
November 15, 2018. 

How is managing a massive cloud-native transformation effort different than the &quot;application modernization factories&quot; that have been around for years? Transforming or modernizing a 
portfolio consisting of hundreds of existing (aka, “brownfield”) applications is an enormous undertaking that requires a highly talented, cross-functional team. 

Attend this webinar with Pivotal, CGI, and 451 Research’s Carl Books to learn about the nuts and bolts of managing cloud-native application transformation at scale. After an overview from 451 Research, we’ll dive deep on the roles, tools, and processes required to create a well-run, cloud-native application transformation. 

Join us to hear how to replicate this success in your own organization! 

Presenters: 
Mark Carlson, VP, Cloud Native Services, CGI 
Carl Brooks, Analyst, 451 
Research
Jeff Kelly, Director of Product Marketing, Pivotal
