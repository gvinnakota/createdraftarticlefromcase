    <subject>New Pivotal Academy is launching on November 18th!</subject>
    <textOnly>Pivotal is launching our new Pivotal Academy for Partner Learning Management System (LMS) on Wednesday, November 18th! The new and improved portal includes an extensive library of free eLearning classes, instructor and course scheduling, improved search capabilities and much more.



In preparation for the new system, access to the current LMS will be unavailable on Tuesday, November 17th. Service will be suspended for approximately 24-hours and should be restored on Wednesday, November 18th. All users will receive an email notification from the new LMS once the system is accessible.



Prior to your service being suspended on Tuesday, November 17th, we would like to share several important updates about your service. Please review and take the necessary actions before Tuesday, November 17th.



	- Classes In-Progress


	- If you are presently enrolled in an online training class and wish to complete the class, please finish all remaining modules immediately.

	- Classes that are in-progress will revert back to the original starting point within our new LMS. Partially completed course data will not transfer over.







	- Certificates of Completion


	- If you have completed a class and wish to print a Course Completion Certificate, select &quot;Certificates&quot; from your Dashboard and choose the corresponding course. Your certificate will automatically download.

	- Course Completion Certificates for previously completed courses will NOT be available in the new LMS.







	- Enrolling in a Class


	- Pivotal Academy recommends you do not start a new class unless you plan on completing all modules beforeÂ Tuesday, November 17th.

	- Pivotal Academy will continually add new and updated classes to the LMS - providing you and your staff with a growing library of online training modules. Select online classes from our current system may be retired and no longer available.







	- Accessing the new Pivotal Academy for Partners LMS


	- Pivotal Academy anticipates the new LMS will be available approximately 24-hours after service has been suspended. All users will receive an email notification from the new LMS once the system is accessible.
	- Your first / last name and email address will transfer to the new system.
	- To access your account, please use the email address provided when you created your existing account.
	- You will need to create a new password upon logging in. Previous passwords will not transfer.
	- NOTE: If you previously bookmarked academy.pivotal.io &lt;http://academy.pivotal.io/&gt;, please delete this bookmark, clear your cache, and re-bookmark the link to ensure you are directed to our new LMS.






Pivotal Academy is excited to bring you our next generation LMS. We are building a wealth of features and additional functionality over the coming months in order to provide you and your team with a truly unique and enriching learning experience.
