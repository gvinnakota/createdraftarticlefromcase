    <subject>New Customer Briefings Program</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello Sales Field,

It is with great pleasure that we introduce Daniel Opine &lt;mailto:dopine@pivotal.io&gt;, as Pivotal&apos;s very own Customer Briefing Advisor. Daniel will assume day-to-day management of the Customer Briefings Program, acting as both master scheduler and primary point of contact to the field.

To help the field get up to speed as quickly as possible over the next few weeks, we’ll be participating in an upcoming 
Spotlight Webinar on October 15th, 2015, as well as joining regional field calls to provide feedback and answer any questions you may have.

Moreover, we are pleased to offer you a one-stop-shop for requesting briefing support. Below you will find a 3 step process to help make your upcoming Customer Briefing a success!

1. How to reach us?

For general program related questions, please use our new email alias at sales-briefings@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:sales-briefings@pivotal.io&gt;. This email alias includes a team of briefing 
experts that will help get you started and point you in the right direction.

2. How to schedule a Customer Briefing?

One form to rule them all... it’s new, it’s easy and now it’s live! All requests for Customer Briefing support will require the requester to complete the Pivotal Briefing Request Form &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/forms/d/173st8JGIZ1B3jCo-gPSUIYi5WtVLOlpqXjwSlqse3DA/viewform?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRomrfCcI63Em2iQPJWpsrB0B%2FDC18kX3RUvIr%2BZbgfind1SFJk7a8C6XFRCRt1I9SYVSrDM&gt;. Once the form is submitted, your input will automatically be sent to the Sales Briefings team and a representative will be in contact with you within 48 hours to confirm your briefing.


 - Lead time is key! Advanced notice enables us to ensure a successful briefing.
 - Once your request is submitted, to help reduce email traffic to EAs and department leads, we would ask that you please allow us to secure speakers on your behalf. 
 - Details matter, the more information you can include in your notes the better!



3. How do I learn more about the Customer Briefing Program?

To learn more about the program, please refer to the Program 
Overview presentation that will help you better understand the processes including, meeting types defined and role &amp; responsibilities.

Please note that Customer Briefing support is reserved for executive level visits and all non-executive level meetings and ad-hoc 
customer visits should continue to be organized by the field representative.

We look forward to hearing your feedback and appreciate your support!


Good Selling!
