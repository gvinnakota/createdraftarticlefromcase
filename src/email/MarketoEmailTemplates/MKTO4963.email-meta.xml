    <textOnly>Hello,
 
 Thank you for visiting Pivotal’s booth at RedisConf 2017!

At Pivotal, we know that waiting for a Redis instance to be set-up can get in the way of developers doing they love most, creating amazing software! That’s why Pivotal Cloud Foundry offers a way for ops teams to provide a dedicated, pre-provisioned Redis service that works on any cloud — so that your developers can spend more time coding and less time thumb-twiddling.

In fact, the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Services Marketplace &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/platform/services?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=redisconf-sf-q217]]&gt; provides users with on-demand provisioning of add-on services that help you enhance, secure, and manage your applications, from data persistence, caching, messaging to continuous integration.

To learn about Pivotal’s on-demand services for Redis, please join our upcoming webinar: The Fastest Way to Redis on Pivotal Cloud Foundry &lt;[[https://www.brighttalk.com/service/player/en-US/theme/default/channel/14883/webcast/263407/play?showChannelList=false]]&gt; on June 28, 2017 at 8:00AM PST.

During this webinar, we&apos;ll cover:


 - Use cases and requirements for developers
