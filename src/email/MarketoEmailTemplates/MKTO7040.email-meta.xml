    <subject>Four proven tips for an Application Transformation strategy</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 


Through our work with some of the world’s leading organizations &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/customers]]&gt; we’ve learned what works and what 
doesn’t on the journey to Application Transformation. From experience, here are our top 4 tips: 


Start small - START WITH ONE BUSINESS UNIT AND A HANDFUL OF APPS
We recommend starting with a set of 5-10 applications built over the last five years using that are of low technical risk and of high business 
relevance. 


Learn by Doing - BUILD A COOKBOOK OF PATTERNS INFORMED BY MOVING INITIAL APPS INTO PROD
Form an internal consulting function around app transformation and augment internal staff (who own and lead the initiative) with external 
resources (that can scale and offer an economic advantage) in a way that ramps over time. The objective is to get 5-10 applications moved into production while capturing lessons/techniques as recipes to streamline and accelerate future efforts. 


Break Big Things Into Small Things - BREAK “SLICES” OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS INTO PIVOTAL CLOUD FOUNDRY (PCF)
Monoliths often span multiple subsystems and data sources and dozens of deployables across a network of servers and 
mainframe backends. By breaking down complex systems into lightweight microservices, you can scale horizontally on a cloud. 

Automate Everything - REDUCE MANUAL PROCESS ACROSS THE PATH-TO-PRODUCTION
We recommend drawing a ​value stream map​ of the end-to-end path to production (for the initial apps only) to identify opportunities to reduce waste through automation.
