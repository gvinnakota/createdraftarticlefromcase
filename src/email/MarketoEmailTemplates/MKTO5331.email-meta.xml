    <subject>Build Great Software with Pivotal</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


Thanks for joining us at Gartner Symposium!


Pivotal is committed to transforming the way the world builds software by providing the right combination of platform and process to support our customers&apos; business imperatives. To say that every company must be a software company is simplifying the challenge organizations face, where speed and agility are king, yet security and reliability are mandatory.


We are passionate about partnering with customers to overcome challenges associated with lengthy enterprise IT cycles. With a proven portfolio of methodologies, a powerful platform, and open-source data and analytics software, Pivotal works with customers to implement new approaches and modern tools to build great software. Make IT a business enabler rather than a cost center! How can you make this happen in your org? Two IT leaders spoke about this in Orlando. Hear their stories in these on-demand videos:
