Tracker&apos;s new and improved GitHub integration







Tracker and GitHub are chocolate and peanut butter when it comes to software development, and with our new native GitHub 
integration &lt;[[https://t.e2ma.net/click/arjuvd/mwjrljb/abf4bzb]]&gt;, they practically combine themselves. You can now automatically attach branches, pull requests, and commits to stories and epics to visualize your code at a glance as it moves through the development process.

Move over, mouse: You can now use the spacebar and arrow keys to move stories around &lt;[[https://pivotaltracker.com/blog/moving-stories-with-the-keyboard]]&gt; within a panel. Need to use your outside voice for a story? There&apos;s a preview function &lt;[[https://pivotaltracker.com/blog/preview-party-previewing-markdown-before-posting]]&gt; for Markdown for double-checking your comments *before* posting.
