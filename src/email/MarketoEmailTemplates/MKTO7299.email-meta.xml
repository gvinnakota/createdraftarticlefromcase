    <subject>4/25/19 Webinar - How to Migrate Applications Off a Mainframe</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar How to Migrate Applications Off a Mainframe,  &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/apr-25-how-to-migrate-applications-off-a-mainframe-webinar?utm_source=promo&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=migrate-mod-mainframe&amp;utm_term=q219]]&gt;on April 25, 2019. 

Ah, the mainframe. Peel back many transactional business applications at any enterprise and you’ll find a mainframe application under there. It’s often where the crown jewels of the business’ data and core transactions are processed. The tooling for these applications is dated and new code is infrequent, but moving off is seen as risky. No one. Wants. To. Touch. Mainframes. 


But mainframe applications don’t have to be the electric third rail. Modernizing, even pieces of those mainframe workloads into modern frameworks on modern platforms, has huge payoffs. Developers can gain all the productivity benefits of modern tooling. Not to mention the scaling, security, and cost benefits. So, how do you get started modernizing applications off a mainframe? 


Join Rohit Kelapure, Consulting Practice Lead at Pivotal, as he shares lessons from projects with 
enterprises to move workloads off of mainframes. You’ll learn: 


	- 
How to decide what to modernize first by looking at business requirements AND the existing codebase

	- 
How to take a test-driven approach to minimize risks in decomposing the mainframe application

	- 
What to use as a replacement or evolution of mainframe schedulers 

	- 
How to include COBOL and other mainframe developers in the process to retain institutional knowledge and defuse project 
detractors 

	- 
How to replatform mainframe applications to the cloud leveraging a spectrum of techniques
