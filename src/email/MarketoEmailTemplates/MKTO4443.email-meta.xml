    <subject>Q3 Wins Capture, Reference Performance Report, and Incentive Leaderboard Update</subject>
    <textOnly>All,

FY15 has been an active year with customers making strong bets with us to transform the way software drives their businesses.  This quarter we saw some 
significant deals in the eight-figure range from both Ford and General Electric--Ford making investments across the Cloud, Data and Labs to make software a driver of their organization and General Electric empowering themselves with Pivotal Cloud Foundry to become a truly digital business.  
 
 Available now is the analysis of Q3 Top Wins &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/customer-marketing-and-programs/assets/external-slides&gt; with anonymized, scripted 
business case slides that you can use to share these stories, and detailed win analysis. In addition, rep interviews on won deals - easily downloadable in .mp4 format.
 
 Also available is the Q3 Reference Performance Report
 Reference activity continues with Allstate and United Continental Holdings demonstrating exceptional leadership in reference activities.  Congratulations to our top reps, John Grosshandler and John Randazzo, who 
have cultivated strong relationships with their accounts resulting in great references!
 
 Reference Incentive Program 
Leaderboard
 There&apos;s still time to complete reference activity towards the 2015 Reference 
Incentive Award program.  Between now and sales kickoff, have your Cloud, Data, or Labs accounts complete and publish an external case study for double points.  Get in touch to get one started.  

If you have any questions or comments on any of the above, please contact me &lt;mailto:stseng@pivotal.io&gt; or customer-marketing@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:customer-marketing@pivotal.io&gt;.
