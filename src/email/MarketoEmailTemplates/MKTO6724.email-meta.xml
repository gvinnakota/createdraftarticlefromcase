Hello - I’m Courtney. As Program Director for the Dell Tech Alliances team at Pivotal, I’m dedicated to accelerating sales growth among my Dell Tech family, with special focus on VMware and Dell EMC.


 


 



 


 

1. MICHAEL DELL NAME DROPS PRA *LIKE A BOSS*
He is, indeed, a boss of ~ 200,000 people... so no surprises here when he touts Pivotal Ready Architecture and confesses that, &quot;The collective strength of our combined capabilities are unparalleled. This is why Dell Technologies is winning in the market.&quot; Video for your viewing pleasure below.

3. Pivotal Pulse Podcast Has Launched!

It’s official. Videos are out, podcasts are in. The amount of time we all spend in transit behind a windshield or on an airplane has fueled adoption of audio content.

Pivotal Pulse Podcast &lt;[[https://soundcloud.com/user-606338988/pra-pks-win-at-telecom-italia/s-TTCUE]]&gt; deconstructs the best strategies for selling joint Dell Tech products to the largest enterprise organizations in the world. They are custom designed to share ideas, lessons, habits, and customer stories that you can leverage to help our customers transform. Themes include: 



	- Sales Wins - feature sales reps who successfully supported customer adoption of a Dell Tech solution. 

	- Executive Strategy - advice from leadership on the latest messaging and strategy. 

	- Customer Spotlight - hear from current customers who rave about working with us.




If you are a VMware or DellEMC rep with a PRA or PKS story, reach out for an interview!

4. IBM Buys Red Hat for $34 Billion

IBM announced that it had reached a definitive agreement to acquire Red Hat for $190 per share, a 60% premium over Red Hat’s Friday closing price ($116). The portfolio rationalization IBM and Red Hat are about to go through may take years to complete and the transaction is not expected to close until the latter half of 2019. 
What’s interesting from IBM’s press release is that they position themselves as the leader in Hybrid Cloud - a position that Pivotal, Dell, and VMware could more rightly claim. We are very much still in the early days of the market but NOW is the time to win significant share as a ‘Better Together’ integrated technology stack. Pivotal Ready Architecture (PRA) with Dell EMC and VMware means we offer the most complete Private Cloud solution available today.

5. Dell EMC, VMware, and Pivotal Land $30M Deal in Italy.

Dell Technologies (Dell EMC, VMware, Pivotal) joined forces to land a $30M deal which included PRA and PKS to help Telecom Italia (TIM) improve customer satisfaction, lower costs, and strengthen their position in the telecom market by building a customer self-service portal. The hurdles this account team went through prior to the win included a CEO change, Italian Government relationship issues, and activist investor board members Vivendi+Elliott Management.

Mirko Cappuccio, Pivotal Account Executive, provides his perspective for really truly winning through these hurdles. He also provides the mindset required for managing the 6+ proud, type-A, opinionated sales reps who represent different companies with different goals and it is amazing.
A format for all styles!
