    <subject>12/13 Webinar - Building a Big Data Fabric with a Next Generation Data Platform</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us &lt;[[https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/14891/291663?utm_source=brighttalk&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=big-data-fabric-q417]]&gt; for the webinar, Building a Big Data Fabric with a Next Generation Data Platform &lt;[[https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/14891/291663?utm_source=brighttalk&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=big-data-fabric-q417]]&gt;, on December 13, 2017. 

For more than 25 years IT organizations have spent many cycles building enterprise data warehouses, but both speed to market and high cost has left people continually 
searching for a better way. Over the last 10 years, many found an answer with Hadoop, but the inability to recruit skilled resources, combined with common enterprise necessities such as ANSI compliant SQL, security and the overall complexity has Hadoop relegated to an inexpensive, but scalable data repository. 

Join Noel Yuhanna from Forrester and Pivotal’s Jacque Istok for an interactive discussion about the most recent data architecture evolution; the Big Data Fabric. During this webinar you will learn: 



	- 
How innovative companies deliver better user experiences by moving fast and staying resilient



	- How does it leverage your existing investments in enterprise data warehouses, data marts, cloud analytics, and Hadoop clusters?


	- 
The role of impactful learning in making a cloud-native transformation happen



	- What skills should you be investing in, to continue evolving with the market?


	- 
What it really means to create a long-lasting, software-driven transformation at scale



	- Can you afford to divert from your existing path? Can you afford not to?


	- The skills and technologies that will ease the move to this new architecture


	- What bets can you place that will keep you moving forward?
