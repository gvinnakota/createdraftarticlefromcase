Pivotal Cloud Foundry 1.7 Released
This post covers the technical highlights from the newly released Pivotal Cloud Foundry 1.7 where application developers now have more tools for rapid feedback with the launch of native application metrics and a local development environment. Pivotal Cloud Foundry 1.7 also marks the addition of private service brokers, route services as a new class of marketplace service, and context-path based routing for simpler application upgrades and refactoring.

Podcast: Dealing With Legacy, Cloud Native &amp; Otherwise
This week, hosts Richard Seroter and Coté talk about dealing with legacy systems, or as they put it: the software in production that you&apos;re sort of afraid to change. They cover many of the driving fears around this type of code, plus discuss some basics of re-platforming legacy applications to Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and importantly, how to avoid getting trapped by legacy in the future. In addition, the pair covers recent news in the cloud native world from security, to AWS outages and how to think about uptime in the public cloud, a round-up of studies that shows small teams are better than large teams, and some interesting anecdotes from the UK GDS.
