    <textOnly>This Month in Spring
February 2019
Hi, Spring fans! What a wild ‘n’ crazy month it&apos;s been! The beginning of the year is a time for celebration for many reasons, not least of which is because we mark off another year in “This Week in Spring,” the weekly chronicle of all things in Springdom that I maintain over at the Spring blog &lt;[[https://spring.io/blog?utm_source=spring-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=spring-newsletter-february-2019]]&gt; (from which I pull most of the content for these monthly This Month in Spring roundups).
 
I&apos;ve been making good progress on my Reactive Spring book &lt;[[http://www.reactivespring.io/]]&gt;, too. Follow @ReactiveSpring &lt;[[https://twitter.com/ReactiveSpring]]&gt; for more.

January was the first full month of my new podcast, A Bootiful Podcast &lt;[[https://soundcloud.com/a-bootiful-podcast]]&gt;, which I hope you&apos;ll subscribe to on Soundcloud, iTunes &lt;[[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/a-bootiful-podcast/id1438691771?mt=2]]&gt;, or wherever fine podcasts are downloaded. Follow @BootifulPodcast &lt;[[https://twitter.com/BootifulPodcast]]&gt; for more. For all of my January highlights, click the link below!
