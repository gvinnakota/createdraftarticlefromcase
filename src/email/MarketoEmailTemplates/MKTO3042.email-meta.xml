    <subject>Thank you for joining Pivotal at SpringOne2GX 2015</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi There,
Washington DC was an amazing event packed with remarkable, pivotal moments and 1000+ attendees - including engineers from some of the largest websites in the world - Rakuten, Alibaba, and Netflix, among others.

Thanks for joining Pivotal, Spring, and the Groovy and Grails communities at SpringOne2GX 2015 &lt;http://www.springone2gx.com&gt;. We hope you enjoyed learning how enterprises are adopting cloud native application architectures to drive modern, software experiences for their customers. If you’d like a hands-on workshop day in your offices or at a nearby hotel, simply inquire here &lt;http://pivotal.io/cloud-native-workshop&gt; to begin a discussion.

In the meantime, start a cloud native journey on the Cloud Native microsite &lt;http://pivotal.io/cloud-native&gt; to learn why it matters, what it looks like and how to become cloud native. And remember to pick up your free copy of the O’Reilly eBook, Migrating to Cloud Native Applications &lt;http://pivotal.io/platform/migrating-to-cloud-native-application-architectures-ebook&gt; on the Pivotal site.

Stay tuned to email or @springone2gx &lt;https://www.twitter.com/springone2gx&gt; for announcements on SpringOne2GX 2016!

The Cloud Natives are coming….
