Hello fellow Pivots, 


With an expected 3,000 plus customers, prospects, partners, and Pivots in attendance, SpringOne Platform (S1P) is shaping up to be quite an event.

To make S1P truly memorable for our guests, let&apos;s remember that we&apos;re all ambassadors for Pivotal. Be kind and gracious hosts, and please keep the following in mind:



	- Take advantage of the conference food! Your conference pass includes conference meals served at the Gaylord National Resort &amp; Convention Center. Food lines will be long, so please treat all attendees as VIPs (that is, let your non-Pivotal peers eat first).

	- We have limited seating for Main Stage sessions. If you notice the room filling up, allow non-Pivotal attendees to find their seats first.

	- Be mindful of what you say, how you say it, and to whom. There will be customers, prospective customers, and a number of news media and analysts present.

	- And of course, have fun and enjoy yourself!




Thank you for your understanding and for your cooperation! If you have any questions about the event please email us at platform@pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto: platform@pivotal.io]]&gt;, visit the Inside Pivotal &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/pivotal.io/insidepivotal/departments/marketing/mktg-event-marketing/mktg-springone-platform-2018?authuser=1]]&gt; page, or join the conversation on Slack at #springoneplatform2018. 
 
Let’s have a great SpringOne Platform!
