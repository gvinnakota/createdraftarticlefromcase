<body ><div ><div class="mktEditable" id="edit_text_1" >Team,<br><br>Two of our most important goals are growing the business and putting Pivotal on a path to profitability.
           This means balancing strategic investments that propel our products and services to hypergrowth with expenditures that create a profitable trajectory.
           Managing this balance with finite resources requires financial discipline.<br><br>We have a clear opportunity to improve our expenses around travel (or T&amp;E).
           Teams that spend the bulk of their time interfacing with customers, such as the Global Field and CSO organizations, account for much of our T&amp;E spend.<br><br>We understand the importance of face-to-face engagements.
           However, we spent roughly $30M dollars on T&amp;E in 2015, with a considerable amount of travel booked outside of policy.
           We believe we can serve our customers well and run our business effectively, while reducing our T&amp;E spend.
           <br><br>Following simple guidelines and T&amp;E policy is the biggest way you can help us reduce unreasonable T&amp;E expenses.
           Be selective in when you travel, and book travel smartly—in advance and in line with T&amp;E policy—whenever possible.
           You can find our T&amp;E policy at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/departments/finance/travel-expense-t-e">T&amp;E and Purchasing site</a> on Inside Pivotal.<br><br>Group leaders will follow up with their teams to offer more specific guidance on our 
       T&amp;E    expense goals and ways to meet them.<br><br>Please work together to make this happen.
           Your diligence here as a Pivotal stakeholder helps keep us on the path to both growth and profitability.<br><br>Bill Cook &amp; Robert O'Donovan</div>
