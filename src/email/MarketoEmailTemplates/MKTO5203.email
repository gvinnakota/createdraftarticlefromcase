<p>All,</p> 
<p dir="ltr">I mentioned at Town Hall that one of our top company priorities is achieving greater autonomy in how we operate, which puts us on a path to becoming a self-sustaining, independent company. As a result, and over the course of the past year, we brought a number of operations formerly administered by Dell/EMC under Pivotal's control—e.g., Pivotal’s benefits and payroll programs.</p> 
<p dir="ltr">To date, Pivotal’s T&amp;E (Travel &amp; Expense) systems have been administered by EMC. As Dell and EMC are now merging their travel systems and processes, we have an opportunity to bring T&amp;E operations under the management and control of Pivotal. T&amp;E is one of our biggest expenses, and managing T&amp;E systems directly will allow us to simplify and customize them to better suit the needs of our business and employees. Over time, this will lead to a simpler, easier travel experience for Pivots.</p> 
<p dir="ltr">The following T&amp;E systems and partners currently managed by Dell will be affected by this transition:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Travel Management Company (Amex Global Business Travel)<br></li> 
<li>Corporate Card Provider (AMEX)</li> 
<li>Expense Reimbursement System (Concur)</li> 
</ul> 
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What This Means Now</strong></p> 
<p dir="ltr">We will begin phasing in some transitions starting mid-September, and expect to have everything completed by January 2018. Please <strong>continue to use your American Express corporate cards </strong>to charge all business expenses, and <strong>continue to use Concur </strong>to process those business expenses, until further notice. Our goal is to transition over with minimal impact to you, and our finance and travel teams will follow up with details and any actions you will need to take throughout this process.</p> 
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What Changes and When</strong></p> 
<p dir="ltr">You can expect the following changes:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Travel Management Company (TMC)</strong>. The TMC manages travel needs online through Concur, or offline through travel agents—including air and lodging bookings, and related activities and responsibilities. Our current Dell-managed TMC is Amex Global Business Travel. Moving forward, Pivotal has decided to partner with Flight Center Management (FCM) as our new TMC. We plan to complete the transition to FCM by <strong>early October 2017</strong>, and will communicate the specifics on managing travel through this new vendor.<br></li> 
<li><strong>Corporate Card Provider</strong>. American Express is our current corporate card provider. As part of the transition to managing our own card provider, we are soliciting bids from vendors (including from Amex) to contract directly with Pivotal. We will keep you posted on the outcome, and expect employees to have new cards by or before <strong>February 2018</strong>.<br></li> 
<li><strong>Expense Reimbursement System</strong>. Concur is the tool used to submit expense reports, and Dell manages its current configuration and processes. In mid-September, Pivotal will start to transition away from the Dell-managed instance of Concur, working directly with Concur to build and manage our own expense reimbursement program. We're planning to complete this transition by <strong>early October 2017</strong>. Our T&amp;E team will follow-up shortly with details and any actions to take and when, with regard to expense reports.<br></li> 
</ul> 
<p dir="ltr">As with any big systems change, there may be some hiccups. Please be empathetic of your peers who are working hard to implement important programs, and are helping Pivotal achieve greater autonomy and operational independence.<br></p>
