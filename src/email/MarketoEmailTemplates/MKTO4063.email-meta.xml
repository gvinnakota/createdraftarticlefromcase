    <subject>Now Available—Pivotal Conferencing Services</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear All,

Pivotal now has its own conferencing services for all employees, which are comprised of BT MeetMe for audio conferencing, and Cisco WebEx for web conferencing. These are the same providers of our previous services through EMC. The difference now is that we are offering these services directly through Pivotal, and no longer through EMC.

Many of you previously received an email &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/pivotal-it/pivotal-conferencing/request#TOC-Example&gt; from BT with the heading &quot;Your new Pivotal Conferencing account details&quot;, in which case you’re all set, as that email has your account details. Please begin using your new account as soon as possible, and be sure to update any scheduled or recurring calls.

Both the MeetMe and WebEx accounts that were provided through EMC will be closed down on November 30, 2015.


 - Please be sure to download any recordings prior to November 30th, as they will not be retained or migrated to your new accounts.
 - Remember to update recurring or scheduled calls with your new conference details.
 - If you didn&apos;t receive an email about your new account details, and/or you would like a Pivotal conferencing services account, please access the following link for instructions on requesting an account: https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/pivotal-it/pivotal-conferencing/request &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/pivotal-it/pivotal-conferencing/request&gt;



Please contact the BT Help Desk &lt;mailto:bt_helpdesk@emcconferencing.com&gt; for any further assistance.

Thank you,

Drew Kramer
