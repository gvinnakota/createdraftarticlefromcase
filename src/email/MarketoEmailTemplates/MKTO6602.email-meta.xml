    <subject>11/8 Webinar - Everything You Wanted to Know About Serverless But Were Afraid to Ask</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar Everything You Wanted to Know About Serverless But Were Afraid to Ask &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/nov-8-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-serverless-but-were-afraid-to-ask-webinar?utm_source=promo&amp;utm_medium=webinar&amp;utm_campaign=serverless-forrester&amp;utm_term=q418]]&gt;, on 
November 8, 2018. 

Developers are excited about serverless computing, and rightfully so. With serverless, developers can spend more time writing code and less time worrying about, you guessed it, servers! But is serverless the right abstraction for every workload? How does serverless differ from an application platform? And despite the name, there need to be servers somewhere … Who’s managing them? Join us for a look at serverless computing and what it means for both 
developers and operations teams in the enterprise. In this webinar, Guest Speaker Forrester VP and Principal Analyst John Rymer and Pivotal’s Mark Fisher will cover: 


	- 
What serverless is (and what it isn’t) 

	- 
The current serverless open source and market landscapes 

	- 
How serverless fits into modern application infrastructure 

	- 
What workloads are best suited to serverless (and which aren’t) 

	- 
Advice to developers (and operations teams) for getting started with serverless 



Presenters: 
Mark Fisher, Pivotal
John Rymer, Forrester VP and Principal Analyst
