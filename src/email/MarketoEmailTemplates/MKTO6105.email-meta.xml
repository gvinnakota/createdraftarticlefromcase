    <subject>What happens when your MuleFlow app goes down?</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 
 
If there’s one thing we all learned at MuleSoft CONNECT 2018, it’s that integration today is more complex than ever. MuleSoft customers taking on Digital Transformation *love* how Anypoint lets them integrate SaaS and on premise systems. They want to govern and manage their APIs. And they know how important it is to promote the reuse of their apps and services. But, your MuleFlow apps still need upkeep to stay available, scale as needed, and remain secure. And you put a lot of effort into doing just that on an increasing number of different platforms. Ask yourself - Is all that effort differentiating your business? 
 
 The new 
integrations &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/platform/services-marketplace/messaging-and-integration/mulesoft?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=northam-event-mulesoft-connect-q218]]&gt; between MuleSoft Anypoint and Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) are already helping customers like Liberty Mutual alleviate themselves from the “undifferentiated heavy lifting” of patching, securing, and managing the health of applications, including MuleFlow applications. Check out how they are reliably going from code commit to production in just 10 minutes &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/liberty-mutual?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=northam-event-mulesoft-connect-q218]]&gt;! 
 
More companies are finding that they don&apos;t need to 
build or use bespoke systems for the flexibility of running their applications on premise and in the public cloud.
