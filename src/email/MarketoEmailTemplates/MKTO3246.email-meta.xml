Map &amp; Directions

Please bring your laptop and power cord to fully participate in this hands-on workshop. A Mac or Linux environment is ideal. For the best workshop experience, please prep your laptop prior to attending by following the prerequisites below.

Workshop Prerequisites (will take approximately 35-45 minutes)


 - The accompanying code for this workshop is on Github Microservices, for better or for worse, involve a lot of moving parts. Let&apos;s make sure we can run all those things in this lab.
 - You will need JDK 8, Git, Maven, an IDE and Docker Toolbox &lt;[[https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox]]&gt; in order to follow along.
 - Specify important environment variables before opening any IDEs. Set JAVA_HOME to where the JDK is. If you&apos;re on OSX you can have it set with: export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home`
 - Create an environment variable called DOCKER_HOST that points to your Docker Toolbox machine. On OSX and Windows this will resolve to a virtual machine running in VirtualBox. If you&apos;re on OSX you can have it set with: export DOCKER_HOST=`docker-machine ip default`
 - Install the Cloud Foundry CLI &lt;[[https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/installcf/install-go-cli.html]]&gt;
 - Go to the Spring Initializr &lt;[[http://start.spring.io/]]&gt; and specify the latest stable (non-SNAPSHOT) version of Spring Boot, click the link Switch to the full version, and then choose EVERY checkbox, then click Generate Project.
 - In the shell, run mvn -DskipTests=true clean install to force the resolution of all those dependencies so you&apos;re not stalled later. Then, run mvn clean install to force the resolution of the test scoped dependencies. You may discard this project after you&apos;ve installed everything.
 - Run redis.sh, redis-cli.sh, and graphite.sh of the .sh scripts in the ./bin directory of the cloned Git repository for this workshop. Run bin/psql.sh after you&apos;ve run bin/postgresh.sh and confirm that they all complete and emit no obvious errors
 - Very Important - go to Pivotal Web Services &lt;[[http://run.pivotal.io/]]&gt; and sign up for a Free Trial! You&apos;ll need an account to see this through to the end! No credit card is required, though you&apos;ll need a valid phone number!
