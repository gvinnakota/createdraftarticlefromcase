Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

In this webinar &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/big-data/webinar/data-science-driven-software-product-innovation]]&gt;, Regunathan Radhakrishnan and Srivatsan Ramanujam, both Pivotal data scientists, present how they helped a large financial services company evolve one of its customer-facing applications to meet the changing behavior and needs of users using data science and analytics. By using clustering-based &quot;sessionization&quot; of each user&apos;s activity, along with topic modeling and clustering techniques, the Pivotal team was able to discover typical usage patterns that helped the organization make improvements to its application and identify anomalous user sessions to detect misuse.
