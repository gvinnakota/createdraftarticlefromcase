    <subject>8/29 Webinar: Get the Message Across: Seamlessly Transport Data to Apps, Anywhere</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar Get the Message Across: Seamlessly Transport Data to Apps, Anywhere &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/aug-29-get-the-message-across-seamlessly-transport-data-to-apps-anywhere-webinar?utm_source=digest&amp;utm_medium=webinar&amp;utm_campaign=microservices-solace&amp;utm_term=q318]]&gt;, on August 29, 
2018. 

Modern applications are built to embrace unpredictability and interconnectivity across multiple clouds, legacy systems, and datastores. So how does one avoid cobbling together a slew of purpose-specific messaging and streaming technologies? How does one ensure consistent configuration of security policies, logging, and access to their distributed applications? And how do we do all that against the backdrop of ever-shrinking development cycles? 

Join Jonathan Shabotsky from Solace and Kamala Dasika from Pivotal as 
they discuss:


	- 
Data distribution challenges when connecting diverse endpoints and systems

	- 
Patterns to help normalize the chaos

	- 
Platform and messaging attributes that are key to supporting distributed architectures



Presenters: 
Jonathan Schabowsky, Sr. Architect in the Solace Office of the CTO
Kamala Dasika, Pivotal

Date: Wednesday, August 29, 2018
Time: 11:00am PDT / 2:00pm EDT
