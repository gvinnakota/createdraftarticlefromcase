    <subject>Your NEW Customer Portal is coming soon, providing complete access with SSO</subject>
    <textOnly>Valued Pivotal Customers and Partners, 

 The Global Support Services team at Pivotal (GSS) is excited to announce that our Customer Portal is launching on April 26, 2016. The new portal will provide advanced operational excellence to our customers and partners along with many user-friendly features. With the new Customer Portal, we have enhanced Single Sign On (SSO), Support Entitlements, Ticket Management, User Management and Knowledge Base Access. You will also be able to perform the following functions from a single (SSO-enabled) landing page for a more streamlined experience:

 - Access Pivotal Network to download software 
 - Search our improved Knowledge Base for self-help solutions 
 - View &amp; download documentation 
 - Learn about Pivotal&apos;s support offerings &amp; policies


What happens next? 
The migration window is scheduled for 3 hours (10:00amâ€”1:00pm PDT) on the launch date. During this downtime, you can still submit your tickets through the email channel at customer-service@pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:customer-service@pivotal.io]]&gt;. 

Look out for an invitation from us with the subject line: &quot;Your Pivotal Account Invitation&quot; and the content below to activate your account: 

 - Welcome to the New Pivotal Support Portal 
 - Gain access to the new Pivotal Support Portal by setting up your Pivotal Account login 
 - Verify your email address and set your password

Alternatively, you can sign in at support.pivotal.io with your Pivotal Customer Number (PCN)/Location Reference Number (LRN).
