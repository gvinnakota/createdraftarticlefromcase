<p>Yesterday, EMC issued a <a style="color: #059a91; text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.emc.com/about/news/press/2016/20160830-01.htm">press release</a> announcing that the transaction to merge Dell and EMC was approved by China's Ministry of Commerce, which was the final regulatory condition to closing this deal.<br /><br />Working closely with Michael Dell and what is now the largest    
privately-held technology   company in the world will only help accelerate Pivotal&rsquo;s momentum.<br /><br />Given these exciting developments, you may have seen a flurry of emails sent or forwarded from Federation colleagues.
      <br /><br />Since the Dell/EMC transaction does not change our mission or our ability to continue operating as an independent, fast-moving startup, please remain focused on developing great technology, helping our customers, and winning key deals.
      We have a dedicated cross-functional team to inform all of you on when to take action&mdash;e.g., receive new badges, review FAQs, etc.<br /><br />Between now and next Wednesday (Sept 7), I will send out updates to highlight aspects of the Dell/EMC transaction close that warrant your attention.
      In the meantime, if you do have any concerns, please reach out to your HR business partner, or to Jason Hurst (<u><a style="color: #059a91; text-decoration: none;" href="mailto:jhurst@pivotal.io">jhurst@pivotal.io</a></u>) or Michael Lee (<u><a style="color: #059a91; text-decoration: none;" href="mailto:mlee@pivotal.io">mlee@pivotal.io</a></u>).</p>
