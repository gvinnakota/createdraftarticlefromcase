In the age of cloud-native platforms such as Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes, tying business outcomes to I&amp;O activities remains a top issue. In these two reports leading analyst firms Gartner and Forrester outline some of the most pressing challenges that I&amp;O faces, and how to address them with a combination of cultural shifts, and platform choice. <br><br><strong>Gartner: <a href="https://content.pivotal.io/analyst-reports/top-challenges-facing-io-leaders-in-2018-and-what-to-do-about-them?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=cta&amp;utm_campaign=analyst-top-challenges&amp;utm_term=q218" target="_blank" id="" style="color: #00ae9e; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 400;">Top Challenges Facing I&amp;O Leaders in 2018, and What to Do About Them</a></strong> <br>I&amp;O leaders are faced with significant challenges in 2018. If not addressed, these could have significant negative impacts on the business — and on their careers. The steps outlined in this research can improve I&amp;O's capabilities to more effectively support the digital business. <br><br><strong>Forrester: <a href="https://content.pivotal.io/analyst-reports/an-io-pros-guide-to-platform-as-a-service?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=cta&amp;utm_campaign=io-pros-guide-to-paas&amp;utm_term=q218" target="_blank" id="" style="color: #00ae9e; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 400;">An I&amp;O Pro's Guide to Platform-As-A-Service</a></strong> <br>As I&amp;O professionals enter platform-as-a-service (PaaS) conversations, the temptation is to discuss vendor selection. Success requires a deep understanding of the space and a strong working relationship with development teams; solving for self-service access or PaaS is impossible without mapping to developer wants and skills. This report navigates the three dimensions of the PaaS market, mapping PaaS technologies to various developer requirements. <br><br>Want more?
