    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 
 
Thanks for joining Pivotal and the Spring community at QCon New York. We hope you enjoyed learning how enterprises are adopting cloud-native application architectures to drive modern, software experiences for their customers. If you’d like to talk to us about arranging a hands on workshop day in your offices or at a nearby hotel, simply inquire here &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/cloud-native-workshop?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=northam-event-qcon-nyc-q118]]&gt; to begin a discussion. 
 

Need some dev/test or CI environments? Try running Spring Boot on our public Cloud Foundry instance, Pivotal Web Services &lt;[[http://run.pivotal.io/spring?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=northam-event-qcon-nyc-q118]]&gt;, a platform engineered for Spring Boot.
