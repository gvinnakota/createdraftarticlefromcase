    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

 -  The essential value of data science and the concept of perishable insights. 
 -  Five common pitfalls of data science teams. 
 -  How to dramatically increase the productivity of data scientists. 
 -  The smooth hand-off steps required to operationalize data science models in enterprise applications.
