    <textOnly>Team,

Two of our most important goals are growing the business and putting Pivotal on a path to profitability. This means balancing strategic investments that propel our products and services to hypergrowth with expenditures that create a profitable trajectory. Managing this balance with finite resources requires financial discipline.

We have a clear opportunity to improve our expenses around travel (or T&amp;E). Teams that spend the bulk of their time interfacing with customers, such as the Global Field and CSO organizations, account for much of our T&amp;E spend.

We understand the importance of face-to-face engagements. However, we spent roughly $30M dollars on T&amp;E in 2015, with a considerable amount of travel booked outside of policy. We believe we can serve our customers well and run our business effectively, while reducing our T&amp;E spend. 

Following simple guidelines and T&amp;E policy is the biggest way you can help us reduce unreasonable T&amp;E expenses. Be selective in when you travel, and book travel smartly—in advance and in line with T&amp;E policy—whenever possible. You can find our T&amp;E policy at the T&amp;E and Purchasing site &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/departments/finance/travel-expense-t-e]]&gt; on Inside Pivotal.

Group leaders will follow up with their teams to offer more specific guidance on our T&amp;E expense goals and ways to meet them.

Please work together to make this happen. Your diligence here as a Pivotal stakeholder helps keep us on the path to both growth and profitability.
