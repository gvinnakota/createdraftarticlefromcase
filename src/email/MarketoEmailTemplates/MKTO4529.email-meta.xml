Directions
Scaffolding obscures sight lines to The Warehouse from the Old Street Roundabout, but if you persevere through the building site, youâ€™ll find us!
 

Step-by-Step Directions


 - Exit Subway 4 from Old Street Tube Station
 - Walk up the ramp on your left
 - Immediately in front of you is an advertisement with &quot;Ceviche&quot; and &quot;Maki&quot;; walk past the sign towards a mini courtyard to the right
 - Our building&apos;s revolving doors are on your left 
 - Enter the building, walk down past the coffee shop and you will find the elevators at the end; we are on the 2nd floor
