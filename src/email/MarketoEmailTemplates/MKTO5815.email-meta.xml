    <textOnly>Greetings from Pivotal!

We noticed that you haven’t been opening our promotional emails lately, so we thought we’d check-in to make sure that you would like to continue receiving our marketing materials.





YES, KEEP THE EMAILS COMING &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/welcome-back?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=reactivation-one-2018]]&gt;





Or, if you are tired of hearing from us you can unsubscribe &lt;[[http://connect.pivotal.io/UnsubscribePage.html?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=reactivation-one-2018]]&gt; from receiving these emails by clicking the button below.





I WOULD LIKE TO UNSUBSCRIBE &lt;[[http://connect.pivotal.io/UnsubscribePage.html?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=reactivation-one-2018]]&gt;
