    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 


A huge thank you to JP White and Erika Green of Dick’s Sporting Goods for kicking off the new year on the right foot -- PCF style! Up next, we have two exciting events:



	- February 19th: Virtual call hosted by T-Mobile  &lt;[[https://connect.pivotal.io/pcf-user-group-feb-2019.html]]&gt;

	- April 1st: In-Person meeting at CF Summit, Philadelphia  &lt;[[https://connect.pivotal.io/pcf-user-group-april-2019.html]]&gt;




First up, our next virtual call is with James Webb, Cloud Foundry platform architect at T-Mobile, expanding on his recent talk from KubeCon 2018 &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qcTu2QUtrU&amp;index=251&amp;t=0s]]&gt;. Register here &lt;[[https://connect.pivotal.io/pcf-user-group-feb-2019.html]]&gt; and learn how T-Mobile leveraged their success with PCF to deliver production Kubernetes using PKS

Secondly, our in-person meeting on April 1st will focus on Containers, Kubernetes and Pivotal Container Service (PKS). We’ll kickoff with a keynote from Cornelia Davis, Sr. Director of Technology here at Pivotal. You’ll then have the opportunity to hear from your peers in a series of lightning talks, spend some time with Pivotal experts and explore related ISV offerings. We’ll wrap-up the afternoon with a social mixer, including light refreshments. Register here &lt;[[https://connect.pivotal.io/pcf-user-group-april-2019.html]]&gt;!

As a reminder, these events are not recorded. Please feel free to reach out to your fellow PCF users and invite them to attend as well. To help us plan for future meetings, let us know how you’re enjoying the PCF user group and what we can improve by filling out our survey here &lt;[[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/53WFJ5R]]&gt;.

Looking forward to seeing all of you!
