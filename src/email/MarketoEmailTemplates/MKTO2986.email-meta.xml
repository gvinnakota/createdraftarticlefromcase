    <subject>Transformation Team Update</subject>
    <textOnly>Colleagues,

The Transformation Practice supports our clients through the vast changes that happen within their organizations when they embark on a 
digital transformation. We need experienced, talented leaders in the practice to deliver this work, and are very excited to announce our Transformation team members.

Teresa Leighty joins our group this month. She has worked in a number of startups and spent time in large enterprises helping them reinvent their products and people. Her experience in applying technology to solve problems and the impact this has on people will be invaluable. As Director of Transformation, she will have a team Transformation Leads who will be our client sherpas, supporting and working side-by-side with clients as they take on the great challenge of changing every aspect of how they do business. We are in the process of growing that team. Urmi Chowdhury will report to Teresa and continue to support CoreLogic, and other key enterprise clients. She will also be a key contributor in developing the transformation lead role more fully.

Cornelia Davis has been with Pivotal since its inception, 
leading the Cloud Foundry Platform Engineering group. She is a passionate advocate for our customers and their technology needs, and understands the complexity of changing a company. Appreciation for those client technology needs in the context of broader changes, and bringing solutions to them is a huge strength of Cornelia&apos;s. In the role of CTO of the Transformation Practice, Cornelia will work deeply with our clients to guide them in the use of software and software practices from Pivotal.

Jason Fraser continues to add enormous value in the development of content for the practice, in the delivery of workshops and seminars with our key clients, and in the continued education of clients around lean startup practices. Jason will also be responsible for the facilitation of an internal Transformation working group. This cross-functional group will act as a forum for feedback on the offerings and tools from this group, serve as a mechanism for keeping internal functions aligned, and allow us to role model cross-functional collaboration to our clients.

Paula Kwan has been leading our newly formed Global Expansion group. This group is responsible for fostering transparency, collaboration and accountability of all Pivotal office opening activities through our playbook and project management capabilities. This group also facilitates the decision-making processes around the sequence and timing of new openings for Pivotal.

Janice Fraser will be moving to a new role within Pivotal. I would like to thank Janice for her terrific work over the past two years in the development of the Innovation Group. Janice has made a big impact both internally and with our clients, and we wish her much success in her new work.

As always, we look forward to any feedback and ideas as we develop this practice. We will continue to hire for both our Transformation Leads function and the Global Expansion group.
