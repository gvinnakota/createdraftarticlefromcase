    <subject>Correction: Your Pivotal Academy Account</subject>
    <textOnly>You may have received an email from Pivotal Academy announcing our new Learning Management System (LMS). This message was intended for a select group of users who are part of the initial transition and does not apply to your account. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.

Pivotal Academy is excited to invite all users to our new LMS in coming weeks. We are currently preparing your account with content that is customized to your learning needs and will contact you upon availability. In the meantime, you may continue accessing your existing learning portal by visiting https://pivotal.biglms.com/partner &lt;https://pivotal.biglms.com/partner&gt;.
