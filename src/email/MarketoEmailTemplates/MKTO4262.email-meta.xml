    <subject>Webinar: Make Better Decisions, Faster with ISS Knowtify and Pivotal Cloud Foundry</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/iss-knowtify-and-pivotal-cloud-foundry]]&gt;
Hello,
 
 As you build and ship an increasing number of valuable cloud applications, you&apos;ll find that you have a new problem. These applications consume and generate vast amounts of (new) log data that *should* influence your decisions about how to adjust existing app behavior, and what to build next. Is that happening? Are you making data-driven decisions, or relying on gut-feel because there are too many data sources and no way to aggregate and understand it? 

 For apps running on Pivotal Cloud Foundry, there&apos;s a better way. Now you can integrate, visualize, and act on enterprise log data thanks to our new partnership with ISS Knowtify. 

In this webinar &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/iss-knowtify-and-pivotal-cloud-foundry]]&gt;, we&apos;ll look at the power of using application and platform logs to make decisions, the challenges with the status quo, and how the Knowtify Search 
Analytics (KSA) product makes it easier to produce actionable information. More details below:
