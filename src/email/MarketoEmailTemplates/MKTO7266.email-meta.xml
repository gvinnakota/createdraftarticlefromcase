Secure, Modern Infrastructure



 
 
 
 



In August, our main editorial focus was on Secure, Modern Infrastructure. Often we focus on the user-facing applications, but building a solid, secure infrastructure layer is critical to success.

 
 

We’ve organized a few of our most popular pieces of content about secure, modern infrastructure below. However, if you’d like to see all of the content we publish on the topic, the best place to look is in our Content stream &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/secure-modern-infrastructure]]&gt; -- and don’t forget that this stream is embeddable &lt;[[https://partners.pivotal.io/English/Global/sales/partner-information.aspx#contentstream]]&gt; if you’d like always-fresh content for your site!

BEST PRACTICE OF THE MONTH: 
Making the Most of SpringOne Platform 2018


As we covered in our Partner-exclusive webinar last month (replay and slides are here &lt;[[https://partners.pivotal.io/English/Global/more/recordings.aspx]]&gt;), here are some top tips for making the most of your time at SpringOne. Remember, it’s more than just a place to watch and learn!


	- Invite your clients and prospects! By bringing along your own clients, you’re helping to ensure that they get the most out of the conference.
	- Spend time with your customers. Don’t just get them to the conference, but spend time with them. Learn about what is most interesting to them, and take advantage of all the excitement!
	- Get to know the Pivotal account teams. Partnering with Pivotal account teams on a specific target account is the best way to go in with a joint message. Developing those relationships while you’re in-person at S1P is an excellent opportunity.
