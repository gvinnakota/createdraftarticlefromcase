    <subject>New Containers and Pivotal Cloud Foundry White Paper</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

 We invite you to download a free copy of our new white paper: Containers and Pivotal Cloud Foundry.&lt;[[https://pivotal.io/containers-and-pivotal-cloud-foundry?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=wp-Containers-PCF_Q416]]&gt; Containers have become popular with developers and operators alike because they offer a convenient way to achieve benefits that were hard to obtain otherwise, including:

 - Consistency of deployment 
 - Consistency of execution 
 - Easing the Developer-to-Operator handoff

 However, container technology—like Docker—is only one piece of a larger set of responsibilities needed for an enterprise platform. 

 In this white paper, we’ll take a high-level look at container technology and how containers are leveraged by Pivotal Cloud Foundry. We’ll describe how Pivotal Cloud Foundry takes a structured, opinionated view of application deployment and management to drive business value.

 Thanks,
