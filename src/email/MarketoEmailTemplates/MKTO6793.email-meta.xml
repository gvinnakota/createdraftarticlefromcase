    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Our mission at Pivotal is to transform how the world builds and runs software. Leveraging a platform, tools and methodology approach that is based on lean application development principles, we work with leading organisations including Ford, Liberty Mutual, CoreLogic and Yahoo Japan to empower them to build great quality software.
