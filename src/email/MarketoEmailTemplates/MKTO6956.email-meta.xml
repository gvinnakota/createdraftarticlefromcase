    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

I thought you might be interested in the upcoming live webinar: Pivotal Cloud Foundry vs. Kubernetes

It&apos;s tempting to compare Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) and Kubernetes (K8s) to each other. Both are platform services for deploying cloud-native apps and both deal with containers. Itâ€™s important, however, to understand how they differ from each other and when it&apos;s best to use one instead of the other - or whether you should use them together at all. 

So how do you know when you should choose PCF over K8s, and when you should choose both?

Join us for this webinar as we discuss: 
- The differences between PCF and K8s 
- Why to choose one over the other and when to choose both
- What PCF provides to simplify the decision

Featured Speakers:
- David Kari, Senior Manager of Platform Architecture ANZ, Pivotal
- Pas Apicella, Advisory Platform Architect APJ, Pivotal

We look forward to seeing you there.

Regards,

Lionel Lim
Vice President and Managing Director, Asia Pacific &amp; Japan
