    <subject>You’re Invited to the Open Data Platform Initiative (ODPi) Meetup tomorrow!</subject>
    <textOnly>The first release of the Open Data Platform Initiative (ODPi) is coming soon, and there’s still time before the first release to influence the specifications and contribute to the validation test suite!

Attend the ODPi meetup on February 4th if your company develops, integrates with, or uses Apache Hadoop (tm) technologies to learn about the specifications and find out how you can test your distributions and integrated products to ensure compliance.

Important thought leaders within the Hadoop community will be on-hand to answer your questions and hear your feedback. This is your opportunity to help steer a standard that will become the base for accelerating adoption and innovation of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem.
