Hello, my name is Chris Catano and I am from Southern California. I am the ATS Chief Strategist for Pivotal Solutions at Dell Technologies, focused on helping customers partner with Dell Technologies and modernize efforts around applications, delivery models, culture, and processes. 
Pivotal Ready Architecture has been the vehicle to facilitate these efforts and is a great example of how the power of Dell Technologies, VMware, and Pivotal is better together. Welcome to the PRA “Program Edition” of 5 Point Friday!

 


 

 


 

1. Introducing Pivotal Customer[0]



It is with great pride that we released PRA 1.2 with validation now managed by Pivotal. Meet Customer[0], the Pivotal R&amp;D Engineering Team responsible for all of the validation, performance and benchmarking of reference designs that go into Pivotal Platform Releases. Coupling the PRA reference architecture to Pivotal’s engineering expertise creates the most agile development platform product on the market.


What’s being tested and validated?



	- Multiple configurations and sizes of common Deployment Scenarios for PAS and PKS on vSphere on vxRail
	- Performance boundaries, benchmark capacities and chaos resiliency of the reference designs
	- Deltas and trends between GA and previous builds of Pivotal PCF on vSphere +/- NSX on well-defined hardware configs
	- Good guidance built into the PCF sizing tools based on real, empirical data



Why is this important for Dell Tech?



	- We now have the tightest release coupling of any manufacturer for on-prem platform services and thus can get developer tools in the hands of the developers faster than anyone else.




 


 

 


 


2. PRA Starter Kit for PKS




This kit is designed for commercial customers on a budget. If your customer is looking to deploy kubernetes on-prem but has a lower entry point, smaller footprint, edge, ROBO, or is a boutique retail shop, this is designed for them.
 
PKS is in peak demand for our enterprise customers already, this year VMware’s Channel will be activated to sell PKS as well and the ‘Starter Kit’ is a tactical, scale out approach which makes PKS easier for our customers to get their hands on and begin using quickly. 


 


 

 


 


3. Cloud Native Engagement Model


The Pivotal Synergy Team, DellTech Advanced Technologies Solutions Group, and VMware’s Cloud Native Architects (CNA) have formed an integrated network to support sales and presales opportunities. These teams are here to help you land deals. Shoot DellTech ATS an email: ATS.Global.Cloud.Solutions@dell.com &lt;[[mailto:ATS.Global.Cloud.Solutions@dell.com]]&gt;

5. PRA Success Story - West Corp 


West &lt;[[https://www.west.com/]]&gt; is a private telecommunications service provider with approximately $2.6B in revenue and 10k employees. We are excited to have them as our newest Pivotal Ready Architecture customer, with an all-in Dell Tech (Pivotal, VMware, DellEMC) deal size totaling $8.1M, inclusive of $1.23M for 30 VxRail, 2 ECS, Services and Support. The ability to bring all Dell Tech solutions to West Corp enabled us to take out incumbent Cisco and Hitachi and compete with Pure and HP for the business.

Quotes from the Field:




“They reviewed several different proposals from our competitors but the customer shared they had no confidence in their ability to deliver for this workload. The power of us owning the entire stack with Pivotal and VMware was our most valuable proposition.”
- Sara Demers, Enterprise Account Manager, Dell EMC

“I’m so proud of this team. I especially love the fact that you didn’t give up on leveraging the Pivotal win to get the PRA infrastructure. We even used a partner! Thank You.”
- Jeff Sexton, Director of Sales, Dell EMC




- Chris
