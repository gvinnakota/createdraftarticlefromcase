Hello, I’m Maggie Ambrose. I am part of the presales team at Pivotal focused on enablement and selling with Dell Technologies. Below are five quick hitting bits of information to help you engage with customers and prospects about Pivotal.

 


 



 


 


1. Raytheon Delivers PCF on PRA for the US Air Force in 5 Weeks!


This is a GREAT story to share with your prospects: The US Air Force partners with Pivotal &amp; Raytheon to deliver Pivotal Cloud Foundry through Pivotal Ready Architecture (PRA). Raytheon delivered PCF on PRA, with ECS and NSX-V in just 5 weeks - from hardware on-site to applications running. This rapid time to deliver PCF enables the USAF to develop software like a start up &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/blog/the-air-force-proves-modern-software-development-isn-t-just-for-the-private-sector-2]]&gt;!



“We were able to meet a deadline we thought was impossible because of the simplicity of PRA and hyper-converged infrastructure.&quot; - Raytheon





 


 



 


 


2. Partners Bring New Workloads To PKS 

At VMworld last week, one thing that resonated was the buzz around Pivotal Container Service (PKS). Four ISV Partners presented at VMworld about their products running on PKS! This means more potential workloads to identify with your customers to run on PKS - like  CloudBees’ CI/CD Platform, Confluent’s Platform with Apache Kafka, Redis Labs Enterprise, and Crunchy Data’s Postgres SQL offering. These presentations and others from VMWorld are available on VMware’s On-Demand Video Library &lt;[[https://videos.vmworld.com/searchsite/2018?reset=false&amp;searchTXT=pks&amp;=&amp;=true&amp;sessions_search_result_limit=10&amp;sessions_counter=10&amp;stypes_filter=&amp;tracks_filter=&amp;subtracks_filter=&amp;marketsegment_filter=&amp;audience_filter=&amp;prodtopics_filter=&amp;techlevel_filter=&amp;popular_filter=&amp;poster_filter=US,EUROPE&amp;search=pks]]&gt;.

 


 



 


 

3. Positioning PAS and PKS? 

We run numerous workshops for Dell EMC SEs. One question that consistently comes up is, “How do I know if I should be positioning PCF 2.x (PAS &amp; PKS) or PKS only?”
We have come up with 3 questions - guidelines - to address what makes sense where. See below and use this to guide your customer conversations:




Questions

PCF (PAS + PKS)
PKS Only


Who has control of budget?
App Dev
IT Ops



How many developers?
&gt;100
&lt;=100


Developing net new applications or existing ISV applications to run (lift/shift) in containers?
Greenfield/both
Existing applications to lift/shift to containers

5. More Multi-Cloud materials for Dell Technologies 


We (Pivotal, VMware, Dell EMC) all sing the message of multi-cloud regularly to our customers. It is important to acknowledge that some workloads are a great fit for on-premises environments, and some for public cloud environments, and overall - Public Cloud Spending is Up, and Private Cloud, Too &lt;[[https://medium.com/@ghaff/public-cloud-spending-is-up-private-cloud-spending-too-45ac5569269]]&gt;. In the past few weeks many studies &amp; posts have been published with information that Cloud Repatriation is Accelerating in A Multi-Cloud World &lt;[[https://twitter.com/matteastwood/status/1024306935179423745]]&gt;, and advice on How to Consume It Successfully &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/blog/it-s-a-multi-cloud-world-here-s-how-to-consume-it-successfully]]&gt;. These two in particular are great shares for customers in the midst of determining multi-cloud strategy.




Thanks for reading, and as always feel free to reach out!
