    <subject>Vignettes: Sharing Pivotal Stories</subject>
    <textOnly>Today we’re announcing that Cynthia Gaylor is joining Pivotal as our new CFO, starting May 31st and reporting to me.

Our recent Series C funding announcement underscores the progress we’ve made in a short period of time. Over the last three years, Robert O’Donovan has played an important role in our success. He helped us build a solid financial foundation, and most importantly assembled a great Finance team that has helped map out a path to high growth. For that, I want to personally thank him for his leadership and partnership. Robert will continue with Pivotal, reporting to Cynthia.

Cynthia&apos;s experience as Head of Corporate Development at Twitter, and her leadership role at Morgan Stanley in the global technology investment banking group, will help us successfully navigate the challenges and complexities of preparing Pivotal for the next chapter. Her deep understanding of corporate finance and track record of partnering with management teams to capitalize on their most strategic opportunities will be invaluable as we move forward. Over the course of her career, Cynthia has worked on more than 150 transactions that represent over $100 billion in value.

When asked “Why Pivotal?” she said, “The mission is inspiring, the teamwork and collaboration are truly unique, and I deeply believe in Pivotal’s core values—I look forward to partnering with Rob and the team to help achieve Pivotal&apos;s mission of transforming how the world builds software, while helping the business grow at scale.&quot;

Please join me in welcoming Cynthia.
