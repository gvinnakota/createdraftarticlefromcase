Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

 We invite you to join fellow developers from the Atlanta area for a two-day community event of sample code, demos, real-world technical talks, live interaction and networking with industry peers. 

 Java 9 is in the air. We’re rapidly advancing the Spring Framework--adding flexibility to the programming model for cloud-native, reactive, and functional workloads. 

 Don’t miss this opportunity to connect with other Java professionals and participate in technical sessions about all things Spring.
