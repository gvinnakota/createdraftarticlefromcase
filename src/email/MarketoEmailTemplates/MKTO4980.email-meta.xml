    <subject>Business Conduct Guidelines and Complaint Procedure</subject>
    <textOnly>Each year, as part of Pivotal&apos;s Compliance Program, I review and send out to all employees Pivotal&apos;s Business Conduct Guidelines &lt;[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h_6Oy4aDo_1Qa6DXRhU7J9xBFke7ns3fTsdWQ3kpdYQ/edit#]]&gt;.
The Guidelines discuss the application of Pivotal&apos;s three core principles (do the right thing, do what works, and be kind) to various ethical, legal and policy issues that we may face. Please review and follow them.
The Guidelines also contain a Complaint Procedure &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/pivotal-complaint-procedure/]]&gt; and a hotline that allow you to raise good faith concerns, including anonymously. If you have questions or concerns about ethics and compliance, we really want to hear them.
Thank you for your commitment to Pivotal&apos;s principles, and please feel free to contact me at GeneralCounsel@pivotal.io &lt;[[http://info.pivotal.io/Llo2JU00i0hw0Id5Y0N0C0A]]&gt;.
