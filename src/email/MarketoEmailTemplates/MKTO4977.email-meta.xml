    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
SpringOne Platform Call For Proposals &lt;[[https://2017.springoneplatform.io/eSites/s1p/profile]]&gt; is now open!
If you have a software story to share with the world, we would love to have you propose a session &lt;[[https://2017.springoneplatform.io/eSites/s1p/profile]]&gt; for SpringOne Platform, taking place December 4-7, 2017 in San Francisco. We’re looking for stories about application development, continuous delivery, DevOps, microservices, agile, design, data and analytics, and machine learning. Share how you are changing the world with software that people love.

 
Join speakers from Microsoft, Google, Comcast, Liberty Mutual, among others, by submitting a talk &lt;[[https://2017.springoneplatform.io/eSites/s1p/profile]]&gt; to SpringOne Platform.
