    <subject>6/14 Webinar: Running Data Platforms Like Products</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar Running Data Platforms Like Products, &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/jun-14-running-data-platforms-like-products-webinar?utm_source=digest&amp;utm_medium=webinars&amp;utm_campaign=dps-like-products-solstice&amp;utm_term=q218]]&gt; on June 14, 2018. 

Applications need data, but the legacy approach of n-tiered application architecture doesn’t solve for today’s challenges. Developers aren’t empowered to build and iterate their code quickly without lengthy review processes from other teams. New data sources cannot be quickly adopted into application development cycles, and developers are not able to control their own requirements when it comes to data platforms. 

Part of the challenge here is the existing relationship between two groups: developers and DBAs. Developers are trying to go faster, automating build/test/release cycles with CI/CD, and thrive on the autonomy provided by microservices architectures. DBAs are stewards of data protection, governance, and security. Both of these groups are critically important to running data platforms, but many organizations deal with high friction between these teams. As a result, applications get to market more slowly, and it takes longer for customers to see value. 

What if we changed the orientation between developers and DBAs? What if developers consumed data products from data teams? In this session, Pivotal’s Dormain Drewitz and Solstice’s Mike Koleno will speak about:


	- 
Product mindset and how balanced teams can reduce internal friction

	- 
Creating data as a product to align with cloud-native application architectures, like microservices and 
serverless

	- 
Getting started bringing lean principles into your data organization

	- 
Balancing data usability with data protection, governance, and security
