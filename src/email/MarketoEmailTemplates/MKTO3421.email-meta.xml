    <textOnly>Thank you for downloading the O’Reilly report on Migrating to Cloud Native Application Architectures &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform/migrating-to-cloud-native-application-architectures-ebook?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=text-link&amp;utm_campaign=oreilly-Stine-ebook-q116]]&gt; authored by Matt Stine, Senior Product Manager, Spring Cloud Services for Pivotal Cloud Foundry at Pivotal.

This O’Reilly report defines the unique characteristics of cloud native application architectures such as microservices and twelve-factor applications. Stine examines the cultural, organizational, and technical changes necessary to migrate traditional monolithic applications and service-oriented architectures to cloud native architectures. You’ll also find a Migration Cookbook, with recipes for decomposing monolithic applications into microservices, implementing fault-tolerant patterns, and performing automated testing of cloud native services.
