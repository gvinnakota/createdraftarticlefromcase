    <textOnly>Thank you for downloading the Beyond the 12-factor App &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/beyond-the-twelve-factor-app]]&gt; eBook authored by Kevin Hoffman, Advisory Solutions Architect at Pivotal. 

 This eBook takes you through each factor in detail, explaining why these guidelines are important and, in some cases, pointing out how and why today’s new approaches work better. You’ll learn exactly what a 12-factor app is, and discover how to evaluate your existing applications against the guidelines in this book.
