    <subject>3/13/18 Introducing Spring Boot 2.0</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar, Introducing Spring Boot 2.0 &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/mar-13-introducing-reactive-spring-boot-2-0-webinar?utm_source=digest&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=springboot2.0-q118]]&gt; on March 13, 2018. 

The highly anticipated Reactive Spring Boot 2.0 has arrived! We are excited to offer reactive programming with full web tier support with WebFlux, WebFlux.fn and client 
side HTTP, alongside the traditional blocking Spring MVC model. 

The release of Reactive Spring Boot 2.0 debuts major new additional capabilities like micrometer.io. &lt;[[http://micrometer.io/]]&gt; It completely overhauls security, actuators, and the gradle plugin, as well as updating many naming conventions and data formats. 

There is a lot to learn, so reserve your seat with Phil Webb and the Spring Boot team as they help you navigate the new bits. Build something meaningful with Spring Boot 2.0!
