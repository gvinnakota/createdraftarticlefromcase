    <subject>7/19 Webinar: Bringing Microservices to .NET: Modernizing Windows Applications as Cloud-Native</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar Bringing Microservices to .NET: Modernizing Windows Applications as 
Cloud-Native &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/jul-19-bringing-microservices-to-net-modernizing-windows-applications-as-cloud-native-webinar?utm_source=digest&amp;utm_medium=webinars&amp;utm_campaign=.net-cn-magenic&amp;utm_term=q218]]&gt;, on July 19, 2018. 

Building a new application with the latest and greatest methodologies and frameworks? Sounds like fun! Modernizing the legacy .NET applications that have been driving your business for 
years? Sounds…painful. 

Fortunately, a number of new technologies have emerged for the .NET ecosystem to support cloud-native .NET applications, and the processes for analyzing and modernizing them have matured. 

In this webinar, join Magenic&apos;s Robert Sirchia and Pivotal&apos;s Chris Umbel to learn about modernizing .NET applications from a legacy Windows environment. The session will cover topics including:


	- 
How can I determine which .NET applications from my portfolio to modernize?

	- 
How do I decompose a monolithic .NET application into logical business domains?

	- 
Which technologies, like Steeltoe, are available to adopt modern microservices architectures for .NET 
applications?

	- 
How do I analyze the cloud-suitability of a portfolio of applications and prioritize it for modernization?



Presenters: 
Chris Umbel, Pivotal 
Robert Sirchia, Magenic

Date: Thursday, July 19, 2018
