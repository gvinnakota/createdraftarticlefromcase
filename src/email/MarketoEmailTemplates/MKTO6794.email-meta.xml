    <subject>It was great to see you this year at Devoxx</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=}} {{lead.Last Name:default=}},

Thank you for joining us and the Spring community 
at Devoxx Belgium. There were several great talks on serverless, Kubernetes, cloud platforms, and Spring. Pivotal engineers delivered a handful of talks on things like Java, Spring, Kotlin, event-driven architecture, and DevOps. Want more? If you’d like to talk to us about arranging a hands-on workshop day in your offices or at a nearby hotel, simply inquire here &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/cloud-native-workshop?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=emea-event-Devoxx-Belgium-germany-q418]]&gt; to begin a 
discussion.


In the meantime, if you are looking for spare capacity for CI builds, temporary development or test environments, check out Pivotal Web Services &lt;[[https://run.pivotal.io/spring?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=emea-event-Devoxx-Belgium-germany-q418]]&gt;, a great public cloud for running Spring Framework (and .NET) on Cloud Foundry.
