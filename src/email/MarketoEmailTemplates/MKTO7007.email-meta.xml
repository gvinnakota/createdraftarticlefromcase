    <subject>Complimentary Analyst Reports: Infrastructure and Ops in a Cloud-Native World</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


In an era where technology leaders are measured on producing tangible business outcomes, their Infrastructure and 
Operations (I&amp;O) teams are being challenged to address a wide range of issues from platform choice, to outdated processes that breed siloed teams and hinder innovation. In the age of cloud-native platforms such as Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes, tying business outcomes to I&amp;O activities remains a top issue. In these two reports leading analyst firms Gartner and Forrester outline some of the most pressing challenges that I&amp;O faces, and how to address them with a combination of cultural shifts, and platform choice. 

Gartner: Top Challenges Facing I&amp;O Leaders in 2018, and What to Do About 
Them &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/analyst-reports/top-challenges-facing-io-leaders-in-2018-and-what-to-do-about-them?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=cta&amp;utm_campaign=analyst-top-challenges&amp;utm_term=q218]]&gt; 
I&amp;O leaders are faced with significant challenges in 2018. If not addressed, these could have significant negative impacts on the business — and on their careers. The steps outlined in this research can improve I&amp;O&apos;s capabilities to more effectively support the digital business. 

Forrester: An I&amp;O Pro&apos;s Guide to Platform-As-A-Service &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/analyst-reports/an-io-pros-guide-to-platform-as-a-service?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=cta&amp;utm_campaign=io-pros-guide-to-paas&amp;utm_term=q218]]&gt; 
As I&amp;O professionals 
enter platform-as-a-service (PaaS) conversations, the temptation is to discuss vendor selection. Success requires a deep understanding of the space and a strong working relationship with development teams; solving for self-service access or PaaS is impossible without mapping to developer wants and skills. This report navigates the three dimensions of the PaaS market, mapping PaaS technologies to various developer requirements.
