Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 
While the exact path to cloud-native is unique to each organization, the goal is the same. Namely, organizations delivering valuable features to users in the form of custom-written software that&apos;s continually improved through rapid iteration. Organizations use these capabilities to continually innovate how their business functions, ensuring that they resist getting frozen in time. Instead, organizations use this new ability to rapidly and reliably innovate, creating programmable businesses. 
 
This eBook addresses the organizational challenges and changes that come with becoming cloud-native and, hopefully, encourages you to get started on your cloud-native journey by providing just enough of a toolkit to bootstrap transformation. 
 
In this complimentary eBook &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/ebooks/crafting-your-cloud-native-strategy?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=q2-2017-eBook]]&gt; from Michael Coté, you will learn about:
 • IT’s role in the era of transient advantage
 • DevOps and agile software practices
 • Organizational change in cloud-native transformations
 • Risk management and security
 • Dealing with legacy applications
 • Using a cloud platform to automate, standardize and  control code deployments
