    <subject>Announcing the SpringOne Platform Conference</subject>
    <textOnly>Team,

I’m excited to announce our first-ever cross Pivotal conference: SpringOne Platform, August 1–4 2016. By building on Spring’s community momentum we will gather thousands of developers, IT practitioners and executives together to continue to transform how the world builds software. 

 Last year, the Spring team joined forces with Pivotal Labs and Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) to enhance the world’s most powerful continuous innovation cloud platform. Over 70% of Pivotal Labs projects are now written using Spring. Our largest customers view our ability to provide a modern cloud native framework, development culture, and multi-cloud platform as an unbeatable combination. 

 PCF’s meteoric rise as the cloud platform for the world’s largest enterprises—Ford, Daimler, Comcast, Home Depot, etc.—can be attributed to its integration with Spring. Now the combination of PCF and Spring has created a platform with a built-in framework that empowers developers to help the world’s largest companies build their own platforms to realize their biggest ambitions—from the internet-of-things to connected car strategies. 

 Pivotal will host our first conference called SpringOne Platform, at the Aria in Las Vegas, on August 1–4, 2016, where we anticipate thousands of developers and customers. 

 SpringOne Platform will be an opportunity to unify the entire company under our singular mission to transform how the world builds software. We will share our stories, experiences, and expertise to engage with each other, our customers, and the industry at large. Bringing together developers, operators, product managers, data scientists, designers and business leaders to expand each other’s understanding creates a one-of-a-kind opportunity for a one-of-a-kind company. 

 In the coming weeks there will be specific calls to action for everyone to get involved—from alerting your customers about the event, to encouraging them to attend and submit talks, and planning and submitting your own talks. 

 In addition, Inside Pivotal &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/corporate-marketing/events/springone-platform-2016]]&gt; and SpringOne Platform &lt;[[http://springoneplatform.io/]]&gt; will have the latest information on the event.
