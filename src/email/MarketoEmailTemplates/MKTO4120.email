<body ><div ><div class="mktEditable" id="edit_text_1" >Tomorrow, Michael Dell will send an internal email formally announcing the close of the Dell/EMC merger and the beginning of Dell Technologies, the world's largest privately-controlled technology company.
 Michael will express his vision for the new Dell Technologies, including the strategically aligned businesses VMware, SecureWorks, and Pivotal.
 <br><br>Over the last ten months, I've gotten to know Michael Dell.
 I first met him at Web Summit in Dublin, Ireland, where we were both giving keynotes as well as speaking together to a small room of Europe’s most promising entrepreneurs.
 He spoke passionately about starting Dell out of his college dorm room, and how he grew it to become one of the world’s largest companies.
 I've come to realize that he still operates with a founder's mindset, and understands well our ambition to transform how the world builds software.
 <br><br>Last February, Michael Dell visited us at Pivotal San Francisco, where he expressed his excitement about our unique approach to transforming the world's largest companies.
 He's been extremely supportive of our mission, and wants us to continue operating as an independent, fast-moving startup.
 As a true partner, Michael Dell will also ensure we have the breadth and depth of the new Dell Technologies organization to help us break into new markets and reach new customers.
 That type of go-to-market support is the envy of every other startup.
 <br><br>To help all of you stay focused on moving full speed ahead, we'll have the latest information posted on <a style="color: #059a91; text-decoration: none;" href="https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/dell-day-1">Inside Pivotal</a>.
 Starting Sept.
 7, you will be able to access "Quick Start" assets that provide an overview of Dell Technologies.
 <br><br>Finally, to celebrate this event, Dell Technologies is holding a live event from multiple Dell and EMC office locations on September 14th.
 Pivotal will stream the celebration broadcast in our event spaces in Denver, London, New York, San Francisco, and Toronto.
 You'll also be able to watch the event from your workstation or laptop, from any Pivotal office.
 More details to follow.
