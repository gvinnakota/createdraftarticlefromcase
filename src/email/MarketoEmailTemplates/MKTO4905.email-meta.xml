    <subject>5/30 Webinar: Automate microservice deployment using Spring Cloud Pipelines</subject>

Continuous Cloud Deployment
Join Marcin Grzejszczak, from Pivotal, to learn how Spring Cloud Pipelines simplify and automate the processes every company goes through when deploying to the cloud. 

 “I have stopped counting how many times I’ve done this from scratch” - was one of the responses to the tweet about starting the project called Spring Cloud Pipelines. Every company sets up a pipeline to take code from your source control, through unit testing and integration testing, to production from scratch. Every company creates some sort of automation to deploy its applications to servers. Enough is enough - time to automate that and focus on delivering business value. 

Date: Wednesday, May 30, 2017
Time: 10:00am PDT / 1:00pm EDT

 In this presentation we’ll go through the contents of the Spring Cloud Pipelines project. We’ll start a new project for which we’ll have a deployment pipeline set up in no time. We’ll deploy to Cloud Foundry and check if our application is backwards compatible so that we can roll it back on production.
We thank you in advance for joining us.
