    <subject>Org Update: Introducing the Expanded Learning &amp; Development Services</subject>
    <textOnly>Colleagues,

Today I’m thrilled to announce the expansion of our internal Learning &amp; Development (L&amp;D) offerings at Pivotal, and that our colleague, Janice Fraser, will be joining my team!

First, I’d like to share with you our plans to expand the Learning &amp; Development initiative. As evidenced by the Pulse survey &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/departments/human-resources/pivotal-pulse-survey]]&gt;, a great many of you believe that Pivotal is a place where you can learn and develop new skills. Continuous learning plays an important role in our development culture at Pivotal, and is central to how we solve hard and important problems.

For 2016, we have enhanced the following areas in Learning &amp; Development:


 - Feedback. Feedback &lt;[[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17uS_g_3gMDAKmIahnSRHfZu6Cw0PvaHG7QS08KlXjjE/edit#slide=id.p4]]&gt; is a cornerstone to ensuring growth and continuous learning for everyone at Pivotal. We want everyone to feel comfortable asking for and providing feedback. We started this initiative earlier in the year, and are exploring ways to improve this with more tools and resources. It has been great to see how some groups use role playing to surface techniques that encourage feedback.
 - Manager Training. According to the Pulse survey, many of you expect your direct manager to support your professional growth. Managers are also looking for ways to become better leaders. We will continue to offer opportunities for managers to gain exposure to new ideas through our leadership series, LeadOn &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/departments/human-resources/lead-on-workshops?pli=1]]&gt;. We also continue to explore more ways to bring Management Fundamentals &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/departments/human-resources/management-fundamentals]]&gt; to more managers across Pivotal. Our goal here is to ensure that every manager has an opportunity to learn key skills that will help them develop their teams, and to succeed as managers and coaches.



We have a unique opportunity to define an industry by showing and teaching our customers how to build great software. To achieve that, we are always working to build a team that finds joy in solving hard problems together, and seeks more efficient ways to collaborate. With this in mind, I would like to welcome Janice Fraser to the L&amp;D team, which is led by Pam Holmberg.

Janice is a leading expert in The Lean Startup methodology. She is also an effective problem solver, dynamic public speaker, expert facilitator, and a thoughtful mentor. Janice will be taking the lead to launch the following offerings:


 - Internal Facilitation: This service is a highly successful tool for examining and making actionable progress on difficult business problems. Using a carefully developed meeting framework, our facilitators guide stakeholders and decision-makers through business problems that are difficult to resolve through other means. Over the past year, internal facilitations have addressed such problems as drafting an agenda for a Pivotal certification program, refactoring the Finance Operations team, and prioritizing internal software development projects. Let us know if you would like to learn more or request an Internal Working Session &lt;[[http://bit.ly/FACILITATION]]&gt;.
 - Facilitator Training: This is a one-day, hands-on experience for groups of 10–12. It introduces collaboration and problem-solving techniques, the Lean Startup validation framework, and the role of the facilitator in group problem solving. This workshop has been taken by more than 250 Pivotal employees over the past year, and has been instrumental in unifying disparate offices and practices. Let us know if you would like to bring Facilitator Training &lt;[[http://bit.ly/FacTrain]]&gt; to your office or team.
 - Mentorship: As Pivotal goes through extraordinary growth, our people are growing in extraordinary ways right along with it. Bill Cook shared recently that “We are—in a good way—tapping people and pulling them up in the organization. They’re doing things that they’ve never done before.” Mentorship helps people of all levels and roles rise to new challenges, envision their future, and find a confident path through the engaging, complex, and sometimes challenging storyline that makes a career. I have asked Janice and Pam to develop a mentorship program for all of Pivotal, starting with a focus on inclusion. Let us know if you’d like to learn more about how you can get a mentor, or become a mentor &lt;[[http://bit.ly/MentorshipPilot]]&gt;.



Please join me in congratulating Janice on her new role. We are very excited to use the principles of Lean Startup to increase collaboration and problem solving across the company.
