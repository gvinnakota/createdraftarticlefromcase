    <subject>Making Your Mac a Safer Place to Work</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi All,

We want everyone to feel confident that everything we develop 
together stays safe. Many of you have already set up your Mac with good basic security settings, and starting on Wednesday, November 18, we&apos;re updating the default basic security settings to cover all Pivotal Macs.

If you don’t already have your local storage encrypted, you&apos;ll also be asked to allow a shutdown and restart to complete the encryption process.

Most of our computers already have these default security settings, but if yours doesn&apos;t, here’s what you can expect:


 - Strong Login Password: But not impossible to remember. Minimum 8 characters, at least one uppercase character, at least one letter, at least one number, and at least one symbol.
 - FileVault 2 Encryption: Encryption protects all the data stored on your computer if it’s stolen or lost, making it impossible to read without your strong login password.
 - Screensaver after 10 minutes: So you can walk away from your computer without worrying about your co-workers changing your desktop background. You can shorten the timeout if you want the screensaver to start sooner.
 - Sophos Cloud: Lightweight virus checking software that stays out of your way and can be configured to better match your situation, if needed.



You can find more details about our security setting defaults on the Computer Security &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/pivotal-it/policies/computer-security&gt; page of the IT wiki. 

If you run into any issues or have any questions, 
please don&apos;t hesitate to email ask@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:ask@pivotal.io&gt; so we can give you a hand.

Thanks,
