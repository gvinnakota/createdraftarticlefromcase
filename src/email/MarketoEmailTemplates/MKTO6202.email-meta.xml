    <subject>8/8 Webinar: Running Spring, .NET, and IBM Watson Voice on PCF 2.0</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar Running Spring, .NET, and IBM Watson Voice on PCF 2.0 &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/aug-8-running-spring-net-and-ibm-watson-voice-on-pcf-2-0-webinar?utm_source=digest&amp;utm_medium=webinars&amp;utm_campaign=.net-watson-pcf2.2&amp;utm_term=q218]]&gt;, on August 8, 2018. 

Join Vince Russo and Peter Blum from Pivotal as they show attendees a real-world example of straddling workloads across Pivotal Application Service (PAS) and Pivotal Container Service 
(PKS). 

In this practitioner-focused webinar, we&apos;ll tour through Spring and .NET versions of an app to receive the output generated by the Watson Voice Gateway (WVG). Then we&apos;ll walk through the PKS-managed Kubernetes cluster using IBM-provided pods for deploying the Watson Voice Gateway (WVG). The cluster will be deployed using the PKS CLI, then the pods will be created with the WVG configuration file. 

The Spring and .NET applications will be deployed on PAS. A third-party VoIP application will be used to call into the Voice Gateway to issue commands, which will be outputted to the Spring and .NET Application for &quot;processing.&quot; Hear directly from our field and R&amp;D experts! 


Presenters: 
Vince Russo and Peter Blum, Pivotal 

Date: Thursday, August 8, 2018
Time: 10:00am PDT / 1:00pm EDT
