    <subject>How to successfully modernize your apps</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 
 
Thank you for stopping by the Pivotal booth at Dynatrace Perform 2018. 
 
If you are a company looking to differentiate your business, and your teams are writing more software than ever, then you need a platform that helps you deliver features faster. Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) is the proven cloud-native platform for companies seeking software-led, digital transformation. 
 
Dynatrace and Pivotal have teamed up to provide full stack monitoring in dynamic environments running apps at scale. We would love to tell you more about how we can help reduce operational overhead, improve system availability and user experience. 

 We can also make introductions to our Platform Architects to discuss the possibility of full day, hands-on workshops. In these workshops your entire team will learn how to successfully modernize your apps, operations and tools so you can get your software to market faster and more efficiently. Meanwhile, take advantage of our library of growing resources, including:
