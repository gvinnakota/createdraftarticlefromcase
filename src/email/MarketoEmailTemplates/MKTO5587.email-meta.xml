    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar, Visualize and Analyze Apache Geode Real-time and Historical Metrics with Grafana &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/feb-1-visualize-and-analyze-apache-geode-real-time-and-historical-metrics-with-grafana-webinar?utm_source=digest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=gemfire-grafana-q118]]&gt; on February 1, 2018. 

Interested in a single dashboard providing a combined picture of both, real-time metrics and analysis of historical statistics for Apache Geode (Pivotal GemFire)? 
During this webinar we will show you how to create a dashboard providing the proper context for interpreting real-time metrics using Grafana - an open platform for analytics and monitoring. 

Accomplishing this requires the consolidation of two monitoring and metrics feeds in GemFire: the real-time metrics accessed via a JMX API; and the “post-mortem” historical statistics accessed via archive files. 

Join us as we describe and demonstrate how these two monitoring and metrics feeds can be combined, providing a unified monitoring and metrics dashboard for GemFire. We will also share common use cases and explore how the Geode Grafana Dashboard Repository, a pre-built collection of Geode-Grafana dashboards, helps create customized, monitoring dashboards.
