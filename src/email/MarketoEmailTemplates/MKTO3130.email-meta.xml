You are invited to an exclusive roundtable luncheon with Bill Cook, President and COO, Pivotal to take place on Thursday 26th November at the Rockpool Bar &amp; Grill between 12 and 2pm.

This exclusive roundtable luncheon will facilitate the exchange of innovative ideas and information among a group of senior executives. The discussion will be moderated by Gavin Jones, MD at Pivotal.

Topics to be covered include:



 - 
Digital Transformation was initially about helping the world&apos;s most admired global brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Home Depot or GE keep up with Tesla, Uber, Amazon and Google. Instead, Pivotal has observed enterprises merging their newfound learnings to become modern software companies with their industry expertise to go from being disrupted to being the disruptors. We will explain what&apos;s happening inside these enterprises.


 - 
Working with Pivotal, enterprises are learning to create software equal or better than Google, which requires a modern software methodology and modern cloud platform. How are enterprises getting started?

 - Silicon Valley is no longer a place. Rather, it&apos;s a state of mind that can be transferred to Sydney, Melbourne, New York, London, Beijing or Tokyo. How is Pivotal working to bring the Silicon Valley culture and mindset to enterprises located all around the world?
