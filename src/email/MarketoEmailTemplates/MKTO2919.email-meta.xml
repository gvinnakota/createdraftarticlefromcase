Webinar: The Cloud Native Journey
The ability to deliver software is no longer a differentiator. In fact, it is a basic requirement for survival. Companies that embrace cloud-native patterns of software delivery will survive; companies that donâ€™t will not. 
 
Register now &lt;http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/the-cloud-native-journey?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=cloud-native-journey-webinar&gt; to join Matt Stine &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/author/mstine&gt;, Sr. Product Manager, Spring Cloud Services for Pivotal Cloud Foundry, as we look at the common patterns that distinguish cloud native companies and the architectures that they employ. We&apos;ll discover that an opinionated platform, one that stretches from the infrastructure all the way to the application framework, rather than ad-hoc automation, is an essential component to an enterprise&apos;s cloud native journey. Join us &lt;http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/the-cloud-native-journey?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=cloud-native-journey-webinar&gt; on Tuesday, October 6 and we will show 
that the combination of Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Spring is that platform.

We hope you can join us!
