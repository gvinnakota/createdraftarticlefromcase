    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

 
Thanks for registering. We look forward to seeing you on June 7.
If you&apos;d like to invite colleagues, please feel free. It&apos;s a great opportunity to learn how organizations are modernizing their software development process, and check out the day-to-day operations of agile teams that work with Pivotal Labs.
Before attending the workshop you may be interested in reading Coté&apos;s booklet, Crafting Your Cloud-Native Strategy &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/ebooks/crafting-your-cloud-native-strategy]]&gt; or one of our many other free eBooks &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/ebooks]]&gt;. In preparation for the afternoon session, you may want to read Matt Stine’s book, Migrating to Cloud-Native Application Architectures &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/ebooks/migrating-to-cloud-native-application-architectures]]&gt; and the referenced The Twelve-factor App &lt;[[https://12factor.net/]]&gt; site/document.
