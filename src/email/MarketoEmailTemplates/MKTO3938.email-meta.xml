 Pivotal Global Support Services (GSS) is excited to announce that Pivotal Customer Portal has launched and we have created DCA customer records in Pivotal’s Customer Database and Entitlement system. This will enable EMC DCA customers with Pivotal Greenplum Database and/or Pivotal Hadoop software to register with Pivotal and:


 - Open service tickets directly with Pivotal Customer Engineering for Pivotal Greenplum Database or Pivotal Hadoop software support. 
 - Access the Pivotal Network to download the latest version of Greenplum Database or Hadoop software. 
 - View &amp; download documentation for Pivotal software products. 
 - Sign up for proactive notification of new Pivotal software releases. 
 - Search the Pivotal Knowledge Base for self-help solutions for Pivotal software products. 
 - Learn about Pivotal&apos;s support offerings &amp; policies for software products. 



 IMPORTANT NOTE: This Portal is only for service and support of your Pivotal Software (Greenplum Database or Hadoop software). You will continue to contact EMC for your DCA appliance hardware service and support. 

 What happens next? 

 On June 20, 2016, you can register with Pivotal at support.pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:support.pivotal.io]]&gt;. This is a one time registration only. The process will include creating a new account, entering your credentials, and Pivotal Customer Number (PCN)/Location Reference Number (LRN), which are provided in this letter. 

 On July 30, 2016, all Greenplum Database and Pivotal Hadoop software open Service Requests (SRs) with EMC’s CSI system will be closed and replicated with Pivotal’s Zendesk tickets. During this transition period, please be advised to close all open tickets at EMC’s CSI if possible.
