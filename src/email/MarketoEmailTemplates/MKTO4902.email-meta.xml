Determining individual customer desire or intent from social media data provides companies, particularly consumer-facing companies, the opportunity to deliver targeted, more effective messaging and convert more sales.
 
In some cases, the job is fairly easy. If someone tweets that she really enjoyed riding in a friend’s Tesla, for example, it’s pretty clear this person is more likely to respond to a targeted offer for an electric car than someone who tweets that they hate Teslas.
 
But in many cases, discerning and capitalizing on customer desire and intent is more challenging. It requires confirming relevance, intent and sentiment, and matching customers with available inventory.
 
Join this webinar and learn how to leverage Twitter data and images to create customized offers, using machine learning APIs. Scott Hajek will describe the data science techniques, tools, and infrastructure to capitalize on this potentially lucrative opportunity.
