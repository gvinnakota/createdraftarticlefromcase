<p>When we were just a single office in San Francisco, sharing our stories with one another was as simple as an impromptu lunch talk.
    Today, Pivotal offices are spread out across the globe, and it's important we do not lose the ability to share stories&mdash;what we've worked on, how we've solved hard problems, and why we're proud of helping clients forge a new future for themselves.
    Furthermore, as we expand and welcome new Pivots to our Product, Labs and Field teams, we want to make them aware of our rich history.
    These stories, even the short anecdotes, are a powerful way to pass along our history and culture to our entire staff.
    <br /><br /> As a result, we're launching a Netflix-style series called <a style="color: #059a91; text-decoration: none;" href="https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/vignettes/home">Vignettes</a>, internal-only documentaries aimed at capturing and building a collection of stories that highlights the people behind our aspirational mission.
    Season One features heritage stories <em>(Google, Tracker)</em>, saving a company from the brink of extinction <em>(Sheet Music Plus)</em>, using our knowledge for good <em>(The White House, Tampon Run)</em>, and our work with startups <em>(Active Junky, Gadfly)</em>&nbsp;and large enterprises <em>(EMC, Penske)</em>.
    The release schedule for these episodes is listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>May 27: <a style="color: #059a91; text-decoration: none;" href="https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/vignettes/episode-s1e1">Google</a>, <a style="color: #059a91; text-decoration: none;" href="https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/vignettes/episode-s1-ep2">Tampon Run</a>, <a style="color: #059a91; text-decoration: none;" 
href="https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/vignettes/episode-s1-ep3">EMC</a>, and <a style="color: #059a91; text-decoration: none;" href="https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/vignettes/episode-s1-ep4">The White House</a></em></li>
<li><em>May 31: Active Junky</em></li>

</ul>
<p>We would like to thank the Pivots featured in Season One&mdash;Alex Basson, Sam Coward, Jessica Crabb, Janice Fraser, Simon Holroyd, Linda Joy, Taylor Kearn, Zach Larson, Mark Michael, Dan Podsedly, Brian Rose, Arjun Sharma, Colin Shield, Taavo Smith, and Brian Watkins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subsequent seasons will feature a diverse array of stories from across Pivotal.
    We hope the Vignettes series inspires people from all areas of the company to share stories of the transformational impact you&rsquo;re having on startups, government organizations, and large enterprises to reshape the world.
       <br /><br /> Edward</p>
