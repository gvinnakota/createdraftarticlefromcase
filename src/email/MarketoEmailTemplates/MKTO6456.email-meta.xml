    <subject>This Month in Spring</subject>
    <textOnly>September 2018
Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Month in Spring! First of all: how do you like these monthly roundups? They working for ya? We sure hope so! My sincerest hope is that there&apos;s an overwhelming amount of information in each installment. The content reflects a curated aggregation of the latest and greatest over a whole month&apos;s time. Even filtered and curated, there&apos;s a ton of stuff! People dig this stuff, after all. :) 
 
One thing I&apos;ve been trying to do a better job of is curating content in other languages. Do you write or produce videos or podcasts in other languages about Pivotal ecosystem technologies like Spring, Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, Redis, Apache Tomcat, RabbitMQ, Apache Geode, and others? I&apos;d love to hear from you by email &lt;[[mailto: josh@joshlong.com]]&gt; or on Twitter &lt;[[https://twitter.com/Starbuxman]]&gt;.
 
We&apos;ve got a ton of good stuff this month! We&apos;re ramping up to SpringOne Platform 2018 &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/?utm_source=spring-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=spring-newsletter-september-2018]]&gt;, being held September 24–27 in Washington, D.C. SpringOne will be the biggest event for all things JVM and enterprise. Want to learn about cloud computing, big data, agile, testing, microservices, and so much more, as applied using technologies like Spring? This conference is the gravity well for the industry. Join us in Washington, D.C. for the premier event for JVM developers where you&apos;ll hear practitioners from all around the ecosystem talking about their work, and how Pivotal helped them get to production faster. You&apos;ll also learn all about the latest and greatest from the source: the engineers working on the technology that underpins your enterprise software.
