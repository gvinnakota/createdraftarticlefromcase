    <subject>Pivotal Breakfast: Driving Innovation with App Transformation Feat. Pivotal CTO APJ</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

I would like to invite you to be my guest at the upcoming event: Driving Innovation with Application Transformation

While evolving customer demands and increased competition drive organisations to place priority on business innovation, the reality is this effort is often hindered by developers working with legacy applications that reside on outdated platforms, use antiquated tools, are sparsely documented and require manual, lengthy processes. You may be missing out on critical product feedback loops due to difficulties in releasing frequent software deployments and therefore delivering a poor customer experience.

Join us for breakfast with your industry peers and our newly appointed Chief Technology Officer APJ, Lawrence Crowther, as we discuss how organisations can transform their legacy applications and business processes in order to accelerate their digital transformation journey and improve time, cost and operational efficiencies - while maintaining security and compliance.

Date: Tuesday, 2nd April 2019
Time: 8:30am - 10:15am (registration opens from 8am)
Location: TEA ROOM, Adjacent Melbourne Supper Club, Level 1/161 Spring St, Melbourne VIC 3000
