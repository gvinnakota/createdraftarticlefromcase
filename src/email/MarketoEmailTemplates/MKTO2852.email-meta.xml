Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

Smartphones, wearables and IoT are driving an increase in 
app messaging and push notifications. Even SMS messaging has been overtaken by Over-the-Top (OTT) messaging. These trends are signaling a change in the experience paradigm, as mobile push replaces web-based pull interaction models. In this rapidly-changing, mobile-centric app world, how will you leverage the new “tap on the shoulder” to drive greater user and customer engagement?
