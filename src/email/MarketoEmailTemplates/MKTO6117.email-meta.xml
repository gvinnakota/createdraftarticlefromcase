    <textOnly>Hi, 

 What do the co-creator of Apache Kafka, a Navy SEAL, and CIO of Boeing have in common? They’re all on the main stage at the upcoming SpringOne Platform 2018 &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/]]&gt;! I’m working hard to find the 
most interesting, engaging, and inspiring keynotes possible. Add that to the hundreds of fascinating breakout sessions, and you’ve got a conference you just can’t afford to miss.

24–27. This is where many of the the world’s largest and most influential companies come to learn how to build terrific software that matters. Hear about the latest innovations with our Spring frameworks, Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry, serverless, cloud-scale architecture, modern operations, scalable data strategies, and more. Take advantage of hundreds of breakout sessions &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/2018/sessions?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=s1p&amp;utm_campaign=springone&amp;utm_term=q218]]&gt;, a dozen or so keynotes, onsite training &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/2018/training?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=s1p&amp;utm_campaign=springone&amp;utm_term=q218]]&gt;, and countless networking opportunities.
