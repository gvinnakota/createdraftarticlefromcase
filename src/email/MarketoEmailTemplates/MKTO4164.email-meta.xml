    <textOnly>Data Microservices in the Cloud
Speakers: Mark Pollack, Mark Fisher

 Spring Cloud Data Flow enables you to create data pipelines for many common use-cases such as data ingestion, real-time analytics and data import/export.

In this webinar, we will introduce Spring Cloud Data Flowâ€™s architecture and walk through the orchestration capabilities of long-running and short-lived data-centric applications, on multiple runtime platforms such as Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, Apache Mesos and Apache YARN.

Spring Cloud Data Flow represents the evolution of Spring XD and retains the DSL to define data pipelines as well as the web based UI designer, but changes the component model from modules that used to run inside a container to standard Spring Boot applications built with Spring Cloud Stream and Spring Cloud Task APIs.
