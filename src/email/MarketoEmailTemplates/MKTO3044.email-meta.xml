Pivotal Academy &lt;https://pivotal.io/academy#datasuite&gt; makes it easy to fully realize the capabilities of our big data technologies with a wide array of hands-on, instructor-led classes. Courses are uniquely designed for developers, system architects and data practitioners, and include real-world examples to help maximize skill retention.

We offer classes that span the entire Pivotal Big Data Suite platform – including Pivotal GemFire, Pivotal Greenplum 
Database, Pivotal HDB and more. Our Data Science courses are also the perfect fit for analysts and engineers who want to explore the role big, fast data plays in modern business applications.

Best of all, our instructor-led classes are now available through December and include many Live Online options. This gives you and your team the ability to attend training without the time and expense of travel.  We even offer a series of web-based courses that allow you to “kick the tires” of our technologies – completely risk free.

To view the latest schedule and register for one of our Pivotal Big Data Suite classes, please visit pivotal.io/academy &lt;http://pivotal.io/academy&gt;.</textOnly>
