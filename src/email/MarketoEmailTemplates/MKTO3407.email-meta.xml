Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Thank you for your interest in Pivotal&apos;s Cloud Native Journey Webinar this week. Here&apos;s a quick recap: 

 - We looked at the common patterns that distinguish cloud native companies and the architectures that they employ.
 - We discovered that an opinionated platform, one that stretches from the infrastructure all the way to the application framework, rather than ad-hoc automation, is an essential component to an enterprise&apos;s cloud native journey.
 - We showed that the combination of Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Spring is the complete cloud native platform.

We invite you to view the replay &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/the-cloud-native-journey-uk]]&gt; and check out the slides &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/the-cloud-native-journey-uk]]&gt;.

microservices and twelve-factor applications. Download it now &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform/migrating-to-cloud-native-application-architectures-ebook?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=cloud-native-journey-webinar-matt-stine-ebook]]&gt;!
