<p>All,</p> 
<p dir="ltr">Mark your calendars for the Pivotal Town Hall on Tuesday, August 22, from 12:30â€“1:30pm (PDT). Join us live in San Francisco or watch it <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fpivotal.zoom.us%2Fj%2F885517994&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG9MWIwN6_neJ3WbzIUZCyt8VOyyA" target="_blank" style="color: #059a91; text-decoration: none;">live on video</a></strong>. We're switching over to a Zoom webinar format, and be on the lookout for a calendar update which will also have this video link. A recording will be made available shortly afterwards on Inside Pivotal.</p> 
<p dir="ltr">Pivot Jeana Alayaay will be our emcee this round, and CEO Rob Mee and CFO Cynthia Gaylor are on the agenda to cover the highlights of a strong first half, and outline our strategy and priorities for the remainder of the year. Rob will also host a panel with Pivotal field and product leaders who spend a great deal of time with customers, covering why Pivotal now resonates with more customers than at any other time, and how together we're staying engaged with them throughout their software journey.</p> 
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Submit Your Questions</strong></p> 
<p dir="ltr">You can submit a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSfnc_FNw1mvjqeGpz4Hso8xeWlID9jhG5QjL33XQB29WXXg/viewform?usp=sf_link#start=openform" target="_blank" style="color: #059a91; text-decoration: none;">question in advance</a> of the Town Hall. With a full agenda, we'll do our best to get to as many of these as we can. Folks will be able to submit questions through Zoom on the day of the event.</p> 
<p dir="ltr">Hope you can join us!</p> 
<p dir="ltr">Bill</p>
