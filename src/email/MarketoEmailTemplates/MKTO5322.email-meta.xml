    <textOnly>Submit Your 5-Minute Lightning Talk
SpringOne Platform is around the corner and so many cool things are in the works. We’ll be sending you updates periodically to keep you posted on activities, talks and more. We’re excited to see you there, and hope you are too! 

 Submit Your Lightning Talk 
Do you have something you’ve wanted to share with your peers, but a 40 minute talk was just too long? Do you think cats hold magical abilities and feel the community needs to know? Then lightning talks &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/lightning-talks?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=s1p-lightning-q317]]&gt; are your chance to showcase your passions, tech knowledge, anything you feel would be compelling, to a lively audience. 

 You have five minutes to present. Build 20 slides that auto-advance every 15 seconds. Captivate us with your exposition. And that’s it. Please fill out the form by November 6th here &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/lightning-talks?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=s1p-lightning-q317]]&gt; (it’s short and sweet, we promise). 

 And Don’t Forget About Our Open Space 
Before the lightning talks, you’ll want to check out our Open Space &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/open-space?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=s1p-lightning-q317]]&gt;, which begins 
at 2pm on Monday, December 4th &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/agenda?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=s1p-lightning-q317]]&gt;. For those unfamiliar with what Open Space is, it is based on an (un)common sense of what people do naturally in productive conversations. We hope you’ll join us for a lively discussion where everyone’s creative energy flows immediately around a variety of ideas. 

 We look forward to seeing you in San Francisco. Stay tuned for more updates!
