    <subject>Vignettes: Sharing Pivotal Stories (Season 2)</subject>
    <textOnly>All,
Last year we launched a Netflix-style series called Vignettes, internal-only documentaries aimed at capturing and building a collection of stories that highlights the people behind our mission. Season Two comes on the heels of overwhelmingly positive feedback around the inaugural season. We hope that in watching these episodes, we can celebrate as a community how Pivots help transform how the world builds software.

 
Season Two &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/vignettes/episode-s2-ep1]]&gt; features heritage stories (Facebook), using our knowledge for good (UCSF, Sundance Institute), and our work with startups (Reel Security), and large enterprises (NBC Universal, ATB Financial, Loblaws).
We would like to thank the Pivots featured in Season Two—Peter Alfvin, Dave Bellotti, Christopher Boone, Jateen Bulsara, Boris Chan, Lucy Feng, Michelle Forszt, Peter Iskandar, Aaron Lawrence, Kiel Levy, Jammy Louie, Michelle Medlock, John Ryan, Nina Sawhney, Tim Schonberger, Abby Sturges, Derek Webb, and Steven Wu.
For future seasons, if you’re inspired to share your stories on the impact you’re having on startups, government organizations, and large enterprises, reach out to vignettes@pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:vignettes@pivotal.io]]&gt; to start the conversation.
