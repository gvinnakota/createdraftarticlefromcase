    <subject>Adopting a Cloud-Native Approach</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Whether your business adopts a public, private or hybrid cloud strategy, you need to ensure your developers have the ability to bring new ideas to market faster and respond to evolving customer demands sooner.

Cloud-Native is an approach to building and running applications that exploits the advantages of the cloud computing delivery model, enabling teams to ship applications faster, reduce risk and support business growth.

Learn how you can adopt a cloud-native approach:

Infographic: The Journey to Cloud-Native: https://d1fto35gcfffzn.cloudfront.net/cloud-native/infographic/Pivotal-The-Journey-to-Cloud-Native.pdf
Learn how a cloud-native platform can automate and integrate the concepts of DevOps, continuous delivery, microservices and containers.

eBook: Embarking on the Cloud-Native Journey to More Agile IT: https://connect.pivotal.io/rs/625-IUJ-009/images/embarking-on-the-cloud-native-journey-to-more-agile-it.pdf
This eBook investigates why companies are looking to become Cloud-Native enterprises and evaluates the three cloud-native journeys - new project development, existing project (or legacy) management and IT transformation.

I trust these resources will help you make transformation real for your organisation.
