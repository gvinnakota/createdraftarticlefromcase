    <subject>Dell/EMC Integration Update</subject>
    <textOnly>Yesterday, EMC issued a press release &lt;[[https://www.emc.com/about/news/press/2016/20160830-01.htm]]&gt; announcing that the transaction to merge Dell and EMC was approved by China&apos;s Ministry of Commerce, which was the final regulatory condition to closing this deal.

Working closely with Michael Dell and what is now the largest 
privately-held technology company in the world will only help accelerate Pivotal’s momentum.

Given these exciting developments, you may have seen a flurry of emails sent or forwarded from Federation colleagues. 

Since the Dell/EMC transaction does not change our mission or our ability to continue operating as an independent, fast-moving startup, please remain focused on developing great technology, helping our customers, and winning key deals. We have a dedicated cross-functional team to inform all of you on when to take action—e.g., receive new badges, review FAQs, etc.

Between now and next Wednesday (Sept 7), I will send out updates to highlight aspects of the Dell/EMC transaction close that warrant your attention. In the meantime, if you do have any concerns, please reach out to your HR business partner, or to Jason Hurst (jhurst@pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:jhurst@pivotal.io]]&gt;) or Michael Lee (mlee@pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:mlee@pivotal.io]]&gt;).
