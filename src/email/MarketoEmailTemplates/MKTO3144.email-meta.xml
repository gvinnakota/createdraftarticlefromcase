    <subject>Introducing our new Chief Information Security Officer, Abe Chen</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi All,

Please join me in welcoming Abe Chen as our new Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and member of my staff.   He will be leading the Information Security team, as well as providing guidance and experience to our product security efforts.  

Prior to joining Pivotal, Abe served as the head of product and information security at Tesla Motors. He has spent his career deploying advanced security techniques and leading teams around the globe across multiple verticals including manufacturing, technology, retail, telecommunication, software, finance, automotive, and education. While at Apple, Abe built the New Product Security organization and worldwide security supply chain audit program. In addition to work at Pivotal, Abe currently also teaches security coursework at UC Santa Cruz Extension

We are excited to have Abe join our leadership team at this important time in our growth.  His knowledge and experience will be invaluable as we look towards our future as a public company.  Please feel free to reach out to Abe with any questions, comments you may have regarding security or any related topic.

Thanks,
