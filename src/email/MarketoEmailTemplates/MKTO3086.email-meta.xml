 All,

 Michael Dell recently stated at Dell World that “... what goes on at Pivotal is quite incredible &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_o3VnXpcMw&gt;.”

 As we move towards the close of an unforgettable 2015, I wanted to update you on the Customer Success 
Organization (CSO), and how it is becoming a more fundamental part of ensuring that Pivotal continues to grow and be successful.

 Our growing momentum was recently captured in an all-time record quarter (Q3) in terms of Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR), which is an important 
measure of our Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data Suite subscription businesses. Furthermore, at our August town hall, we celebrated a record quarter (Q2), announced that Pivotal Cloud Foundry had crossed the $100 million mark in annual bookings run-rate, and noted how the Pivotal Big Data Suite is nearing a similar financial milestone. Pivotal Labs had its best quarter ever (Q3), and is now in 16 cities across the globe. These are all important signs that Pivotal is disrupting traditional legacy vendors, and emerging as a new kind of transformative subscription business leader.

Our Goal
Rob Mee recently stated how “... the plan is to let Pivotal continue to operate as a fast-moving startup with the intent to go public at the appropriate time.” The road to IPO requires us to continue our aggressive acquisition of new customers, but equally important is that our customers consistently 
renew their subscriptions, which minimizes “churn” rates (“churn” means losing customers when they do not renew). The best way to ensure subscription renewals is to make customers successful with our products, meaning they consume them as planned, and accomplish their business goals. Churn is our collective enemy. But with a strong, well-coordinated set of services teams and partners, we can be more certain that our customers will get the intended value from our products, and renew their subscriptions over the long term.

Reorganization
Our traditional 
organizational model has carried us a long way. But over the summer, Bill Cook and I looked to design a customer engagement experience that was less complex and more effective. We want to help sales teams move with greater speed, resolve inefficiencies caused by fragmentation across multiple technical and customer-facing teams, and improve our coordination in helping customers adopt our products. We kept a singular objective in mind: design the organization and operational model in way that minimizes the risk of churn.

The theme: A Culture of Renewals
There is only one remedy for churn: fostering a Culture of Renewals, or a way of 
thinking and acting across teams that is hell-bent on customer satisfaction towards the goal of client retention. This operationally powerful concept speaks directly to our company’s mission of transforming how the world builds software—if a customer renews the Pivotal Cloud Foundry and/or Big Data Suite, it validates that our software is transforming their companies for the better. This is a change in our company’s operating focus that we all need to understand, and in which we all need to participate.

 To foster this culture of renewals, we’re taking several actions:





 - Redefinition and unification of technical teams
We brought the technical customer-facing teams under a single umbrella to create a common culture and collective focus on customer renewals. We then reviewed and redefined each team’s role in the client lifecycle, influenced by the feedback that (a) while our technical teams should stay well-versed on all our products, given the complexity and fast-moving nature of our products, we should separate into a Cloud Foundry group and a Data group; and (b) that our customers would be better served if we had a more porous boundary between pre- and post-sale activities. The leaders of the redefined teams have been announced in the Americas, and their counterparts in EMEA and APJ will be announced later this year. Importantly, we consider Pivotal Labs to be a key part of the technical field, and to inform the overall culture of CSO. Labs has become a powerful, tangible manifestation of Pivotal.



 - Creation of the Blueprint
We must be more deliberate and better aligned in helping customers consume the products and services they have purchased. It is paramount that this collective team has a single and clear picture of the goals each customer has with our products—in particular why they bought what they bought, and when they plan to use it. For this, we will create a Blueprint outlining the expected path to consumption for each customer account. The Blueprint is a simple document jointly created by our sales and services teams, and our customers and partners. The Blueprint will unite all of these teams on a shared mission for the successful customer adoption and renewal of our products.



 - Increased focus on strategic accounts
In the case of large, complex strategic accounts, we recognized the need for additional technical leadership. In these cases, we intend for a technical individual—a Customer Solutions Director (CSD)—to be assigned directly to the account, helping both the sales representative and customer navigate our overall technical team. The CSD will have overall responsibility for the Blueprint, and will be accountable for helping the customer reach the milestones described within, toward the adoption and consumption of our products and services.

By assigning a CSD to an account, we give customers a smoother introduction and more successful long-term experience with our offerings. We also make our sales teams more productive by freeing them up to pursue new business. In the Americas, Mike Barinek will run this CSD team, supported by Keith Martin and Scott Day. The leaders in APJ and EMEA will be announced later this year.



 - Support for organizational transformation
Some clients are looking to truly change their culture at scale—they often say they want to “be like Pivotal Labs”. Our products factor into their vision (in fact, it is with these clients that we expect to create the largest product footprints), but the impediment here is often more organizational than it is technical. We decided that we needed a specific function to specialize in and address the organizational transformation that the adoption of our software often triggers. We have created the Transformation Team, led by Siobhan McFeeney, to lead this area. This practice has already proved invaluable as our clients get off the mark with our products and services.




The result: Customer Success Organization
The Customer Success Organization consists of the Pivotal technologists that work directly with our customers on their journey to adopting Pivotal’s modern platforms, and our approach to software development. The groups that comprise the CSO are united by a common culture based on customer renewals, where progress will be tracked against a Blueprint that is created in collaboration with our sales teams and our customers. Success will ultimately be measured by customers who renew and expand their product subscriptions.

CSO is broad and cross-functional. It includes our technical sales teams and services groups for both product lines (the PDE and PCF Architects &amp; Solutions teams), our Pivotal Labs practice, our Global Support Team, our Education Team, our Customer Solutions Team, and our Transformation Team. Each of these groups represents the transformative spirit of Pivotal to our customers.

As we close out Q4 and mark a historic year, this Blueprint will help us make 2016 even better. It will free up some of the bandwidth of our sales reps, and allow them to pursue new customers. It will also instill and foster a renewals culture in Pivotal that keeps customer churn rates low. All of this will ensure that Pivotal rightfully earns its path to IPO.

We are confident that in the above we have the right strategy, and the talent in place to execute on it. I would like to thank all involved in hammering out the details of this approach, and I’m excited to put our foot down now as we head into 2016.
