    <textOnly>The Data Warehouse in the Age of Digital Transformation
In the past years of Big Data and digital transformation “euphoria”, Hadoop and Spark received most of the attention as platforms for large-scale data management and analytics.

During this webinar, Neil Raden from Hired Brains Research makes the case that an evolved data warehouse implementation continues to play a vital role in the enterprise, providing unique business value that actually aids digital transformation. Attendees will learn:

 - How the role of the data warehouse has evolved over time 
 - Why Hadoop and Spark are not replacements for the data warehouse 
 - How the data warehouse supports digital transformation initiatives 
 - Real-life examples of data warehousing in digital transformation scenarios 
 - Advice and best practices for evolving your own data warehouse practice

Using Data Science to Detect Healthcare Fraud, Waste, and Abuse
Speaker: Hulya Emir-Farinas, Pivotal Master Data Scientist 

Health care spending reached $3.2 trillion in the U.S. in 2015, accounting for over 17% of GDP. Nobody is sure how much of that spending was wasted on fraudulent insurance claims and unnecessary procedures, but $200 billion or more is likely in the ballpark. Data science-driven methods for detecting health care fraud and abuse have the potential to help reduce this price tag and hold bad actors to account. 

 Join Hulya Emir-Farinas, a Master Data Scientist at Pivotal, as she provides a framework for using data science to detect healthcare fraud, shares best practices for applying this framework in real-world scenarios, and illustrates with examples drawn from recent engagements with Pivotal health care clients.
