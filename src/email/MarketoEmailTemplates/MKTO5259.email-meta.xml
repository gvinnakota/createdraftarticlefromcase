    <textOnly>Hi (first name),
 
We invite you to download two new white papers: Running Microservices on Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Multi-Site Pivotal Cloud Foundry: Deployment Topology Patterns and Practices.
				
These complimentary white papers describe how to move to a microservices architecture - and how to do it at scale. Authored by teams of Pivotal Platform Architects and technical staff, these papers offer deep, practical insight into the Pivotal Cloud Foundry cloud-native platform.

Microservices inject speed, agility, and flexibility into enterprise IT. They also add complexity. Check out this white paper to learn how the most successful companies build, run, and operate microservices.

As development velocity increases, cloud-native software development principles, horizontal scaling, and elastic computing put a new twist on the old theme of “availability.” It’s inevitable, then, that multi-site availability becomes a standard requirement, no longer a luxury. Read this white paper and learn about real-world customer deployments and patterns. 

Be sure to regularly check our resources page to see new collateral as it hits the interwebs. 

Enjoy!
