    <subject>Introducing This Month in Spring</subject>
    <textOnly>April 2018
Welcome to the first installment of This Month in Spring, where we’ll review all the news that&apos;s fit to...em...socialize and synergize? (Call it a hunch, but I don&apos;t think that motto&apos;s going to take off.) I&apos;ve been writing This Week in Spring every Tuesday since the first week of 2011, without fail. This Week in Spring is a roundup of news from the latest and greatest through the prism of the Spring community. Over the many, many years, enough people have asked for a digest of the content they could pull in by email. So, here we are, hot off the proverbial presses, all the newsworthy nuggets, GitHub gists, tantalizing tweets, and cloneable code you could ask for in one bursting-at-the-seams email!


I am your host and friendly neighborhood Spring fan, Josh Long (@starbuxman) &lt;[[https://twitter.com/Starbuxman]]&gt;. This column, at its best, is all about you, dear reader! Do you have something you&apos;d like to see shared with the world? Don&apos;t hesitate to reach out.









The Long and short of it &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/blog/this-month-in-spring?utm_source=spring-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=spring-newsletter-april-2018]]&gt;
Introducing SpringOne Tour


SpringOne Platform is getting the band back together and hitting the road for a spring and summer tour to prep for the main event &lt;[[https://springonetour.io/?utm_source=spring-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=spring-newsletter-april-2018]]&gt; this September in 
D.C. Join us May 14–15 in Denver, CO &lt;[[https://springonetour.io/2018/denver?utm_source=spring-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=spring-newsletter-april-2018]]&gt;, where we&apos;ll play old favorites like &quot;Cloud-Native Spring&quot; and &quot;Continuous Deployment to the Cloud,&quot; as well as a new jam, 
&quot;Bootiful Testing.&quot;
Can&apos;t make the Denver date? No sad faces—we&apos;re heading to St Louis, Los Angeles, London, and a slew of other cities &lt;[[https://springonetour.io/?utm_source=spring-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=spring-newsletter-april-2018]]&gt; around the world in the 
coming months, with new dates being added.
