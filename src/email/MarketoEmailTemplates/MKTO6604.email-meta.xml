    <subject>10/24 Webinar - Monitor and Measure Your Way to Successful Digital Transformation</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar Monitor and Measure Your Way to Successful Digital Transformation &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/oct-24-monitor-and-measure-your-way-to-successful-digital-transformation-webinar?utm_source=promo&amp;utm_medium=webinar&amp;utm_campaign=dt-new-relic&amp;utm_term=q418]]&gt;, on October 24, 2018. 

Measuring and showing progress is critical to drive technology adoption and ensure the success of your modernization effort. A wise customer once said, “If you thought getting people to believe digital transformation is possible was tough, wait until you try and convince people that you actually accomplished successful transformation.” 

Most people can relate! What is the language that describes digital transformation success? What are the success metrics of digital transformation that 
enterprises care deeply about? How does one know they are headed in the right direction? 

In this webinar, Pivotal and New Relic will cover how your teams can do the following: 


	- 
Use lean principles and practices as applied to enterprise software delivery to measure transformation impact 

	- 
Easily create dashboards to monitor business and strategic value delivered at every phase of your digital transformation 
journey

	- 
Ensure your entire stack—including infrastructure, cloud platform, applications, containers, and services—is 
tracking toward goals
