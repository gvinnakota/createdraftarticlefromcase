REGISTER &lt;http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/ensuring-cloud-native-success-working-with-legacy-it?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=working-with-legacy-IT-webinar&gt;
Most of us find legacy code intolerable, but it is, after all, the stuff that makes all the money. Organizations embarking on their Cloud Native journey need ways of working with legacy code to ensure that “the stuff that makes all the money“ is well protected, but doesn&apos;t slow down progress.
Join us &lt;http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/ensuring-cloud-native-success-working-with-legacy-it?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=working-with-legacy-IT-webinar&gt; for Part 2 of our Cloud Native Series: Ensuring Cloud Native Success: Working with Legacy IT to learn:


	- How to put proper portfolio management in place
	- How to manage your resources between new and old
	- How to find legacy code bases that are favorable to modernizing
	- How to adapt your governance process. 



We look forward to seeing you,



The Pivotal Team
