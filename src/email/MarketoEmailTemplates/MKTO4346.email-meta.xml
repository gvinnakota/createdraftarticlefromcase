Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there,}} 
 
 Join Allen Duet and Pieter Humphrey from Pivotal, to learn how PCF Metrics enhances the developer experience on Pivotal Cloud Foundry, with a simple and powerful way to troubleshoot app 
health and performance issues. You will see how, with a single, unified interface for events, logs, and metrics, app devs can easily navigate graphs to identify problems and then view logs for that time slice.
 
 And this newest release of PCF Metrics v1.2 extends data availability to two weeks! Following the webinar, we encourage you to try out the new metrics experience on Pivotal Web Services. 
 
 Date: Tuesday, November 29 
 Time: 10:00am PST (San Francisco, GMT-08:00)

 We look forward to you joining us!
