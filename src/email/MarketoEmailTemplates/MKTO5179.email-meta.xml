    <subject>Have you started that application modernization project yet?</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 
Thanks for taking our class, “Which Application Modernization Pattern Is Right For You?”! Hopefully that helped you take the next steps in that application modernization project. 

Or maybe you’d love to have someone like Shaun work with your organization to replatform some of your applications onto Pivotal Cloud Foundry? Let us know. &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/contact]]&gt;


In the meantime, here are some more ways to learn about replatforming and application modernization with Pivotal and Apigee:


	- Learn more about Replatforming &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/replatforming]]&gt;
	- Read about Apigee’s integration with Pivotal Cloud Foundry &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-marketplace/application-tier-networking-and-gateway/apigee]]&gt;
	- Watch a replay of the class, “Journey to Cloud-Native: Where to Start Your App Modernization Process” &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/replatforming/journey-to-cloud-native-where-to-start-in-your-app-modernization-process-2]]&gt;
	- Register for SpringOne Platform &lt;[[https://2017.springoneplatform.io/ehome/s1p/registration]]&gt;, where you’ll hear stories from companies that have replatformed and modernized their applications


Thank You,
