    <subject>Webinars: Introducing Spring Cloud Task &amp; Data Microservices with Spring Cloud Data Flow</subject>
    <textOnly>Introducing Spring Cloud Task
Speaker: Michael Minella, Pivotal



One of the major promises of the cloud is that of flexibility. Today, most applications deployed to the cloud are long running processes that use the flexibility of cloud scaling. But computing is full of short lived tasks that start up, do their work, and then terminate. These tasks are excellent cloud use cases since resources can quickly be provisioned - and reclaimed.



In this webinar, we&apos;ll explore a new project in the Spring Cloud portfolio, Spring Cloud Task, a new framework for developing and orchestrating short-lived microservices. We&apos;ll explore various use cases, build your first task, and discuss how to orchestrate tasks using various techniques. Finally, we&apos;ll peek into the roadmap for the Spring Cloud Task project.

Data Microservices with Spring Cloud Data Flow
Speakers: Mark Fisher &amp; Mark Pollack, Pivotal



The future of scalable data processing is microservices! Building on the ease of development and deployment provided by Spring Boot and the cloud native capabilities of Spring Cloud, the Spring Cloud Stream and Spring Cloud Task projects provide a simple and powerful framework for microservice stream and batch processing.



At a higher level of abstraction, Spring Cloud Data Flow is an integrated orchestration layer that provides a highly productive experience for deploying and managing sophisticated data pipelines consisting of standalone microservices. Streams and tasks are defined using a DSL abstraction and can be managed via shell and a web UI. Furthermore, a pluggable runtime SPI allows Spring Cloud Data Flow to coordinate these applications across a variety of distributed runtime platforms such as Cloud Foundry, Apache Mesos and Apache YARN.



During this webinar you&apos;ll see an overview of Spring Cloud Data Flow, with live demos of streaming and batch apps, on different platforms ranging from local cluster to a remote Cloud to show the simplicity of the developer experience.
