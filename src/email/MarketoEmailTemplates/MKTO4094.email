<body ><div ><div class="mktEditable" id="edit_text_1" ><p>Hi All, <br /><br /> We currently leverage EMC for our office access systems&mdash;essentially the ID badges and badge readers that allow us to access and gain entrance to our offices. The Dell/EMC merger, which we expect to close in the coming weeks, will require a change in these access systems and the need for everyone who has a Pivotal photo ID badge to receive a new Pivotal ID badge. <br /><br /> This process will start next week, August 29th.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>New Pivotal badges will be mailed to each Pivotal office, and your local concierge team will alert you when they're ready for pick-up. For offices without concierges, a designated local site administrator will receive and distribute the badges.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Your concierge/local administrator will contact you to distribute your new Pivotal badge. If you work from a home office, your new badge will be sent to your home address.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>The new Pivotal badges </span><u><span>will not</span></u><span> be immediately active, so please keep and use your current badge until notified. We'll issue a memo to all of Pivotal to advise you when the new badges will become active.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Once the new Pivotal badges are activated, you'll be asked to return your old badge to your concierge administrator.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Again, if your current badge does not have your photo on it, no action is required. </span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A small fraction of Pivotal employees work out of EMC buildings and also have EMC badges. We're working with EMC to distribute to these individuals new Dell/EMC badges. <br /><br /> If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your manager, or open a ticket at <a href="mailto:ask@pivotal.io">ask@pivotal.io</a>. <br /><br />Robert McCormick</p></div>
