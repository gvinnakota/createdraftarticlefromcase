Hello Geode Summit attendees:


Wow! We had 400+ attendees at the Geode Summit. We believe in nurturing open source communities, and your interest in this event was a resounding endorsement of our investment in the Geode community. 

 Thanks for being patient with us as we re-arranged the room to increase seating capacity. We hear you loud and clear - this is a topic of great interest to you. Next time, we’ll try harder at more accurately forecasting the attendance, and choosing an appropriate room size. 

 If you missed any of the Geode sessions or want to send recordings to your colleagues, you can access the Summit recordings here &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPsH3CO08ts&amp;list=PL62pIycqXx-ShuJ1YpV2wlmNZodnqzY8T]]&gt;. If you want access to all SpringOne Platform sessions, the full set of recordings can be found here &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAdzTan_eSPQsR_aqYBQxpYTEQZnjhTN6&amp;disable_polymer=true]]&gt;. 

 We’ll let you know more about the next Geode Summit in the months to come. Meanwhile, here are some resources that we hope you’ll find useful: 



	- The Geode project page &lt;[[http://geode.apache.org/]]&gt;, from where you can download the software.
