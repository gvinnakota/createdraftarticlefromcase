Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 
 We invite you to join fellow developers from the Atlanta area for a two-day community event of sample code, demos, real-world technical talks, live interaction and networking with industry peers. 

 Java 9 is in the air. We’re rapidly advancing the Spring Framework--adding flexibility to the programming model for cloud-native, reactive, and functional workloads. 

 Don’t miss this opportunity to connect with other Java professionals and participate in technical sessions about all things Spring. 

Register now &lt;[[https://www.springdays.io/ehome/spring-days/atlanta?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=global-event-spring-days-2017]]&gt; for $200.00 USD; space is limited and it will sell out.
