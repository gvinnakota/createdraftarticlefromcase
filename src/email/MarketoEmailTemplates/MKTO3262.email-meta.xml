A Message from Bill Cook
Make the Most of the Last Days of 2015
Team,



As we get close to wrapping an awesome year, I want to remind you and your significant other about the great achievementÂ clubs for those who meet their goals.


 There is still time left for you to qualify for a club, but it&apos;s running out fast.
I sincerely hope to see as many of you as possible at both of these amazing venues.


 Good luck closing out the year, and I wish you and your family a very happy and peaceful holiday!



With esteem,</textOnly>
