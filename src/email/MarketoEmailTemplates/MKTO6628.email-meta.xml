    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

We invite you to view the webinar recording of The Accelerate State of DevOps Report &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/oct-11-the-accelerate-state-of-devops-report-webinar?utm_source=emea-promo&amp;utm_medium=webinar&amp;utm_campaign=dora-forsgren-seroter&amp;utm_term=q418]]&gt;. 

The Accelerate State of DevOps Report is the result of five years of research—with over 30,000 data points—to understand high performance in the context of software 
development, and the factors that predict it: 


	- 
Software delivery performance unlocks several competitive advantages including increased profitability, productivity, 
market share, customer service, and ability to achieve organization or mission goals.

	- 
Not just using cloud infrastructure, but implementing cloud as it’s intended to be used, contributes to high 
performance. 

	- 
Outsourcing may save money in the short term, but is much more likely to contribute to low performance. 

	- 
Identifying key technological practices can drive high performance across your organization (and evidence that industry 
vertical doesn’t matter).



Presenters: 
Dr. Nicole Forsgren is Co-founder, CEO and Chief Scientist at DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) 
Richard Seroter is a Senior Director of Product for Pivotal
