<p dir="ltr"><strong>Attending SpringOne Platform</strong></p> 
<p dir="ltr">If you would like to attend SpringOne Platform, you will need your manager’s approval. Please know that your cost center will be charged $1,025. Once you have manager approval, please register before <strong>November 3</strong>, using this <a href="http://info.pivotal.io/I0r0pI50NoYgAC2l0i0UJ00" target="_blank" style="color: #059a91; text-decoration: none;">employee registration link</a>&nbsp;(the link is for internal use only, <strong>please do not share it with anyone outside of Pivotal</strong>).</p> 
<p dir="ltr">Make sure to use your Pivotal email address when you register, so we can verify that you are an employee. Due to limited seating, we are asking Pivotal employees <strong>not to sign up for training</strong> until we get closer to the conference date.</p> 
<p dir="ltr"><em>Guidelines for Platform Architects</em><br></p>
