Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 

Technologies to develop, test, and run software are out-pacing most organizations&apos; abilities to innovate and succeed in a time when software is a critical business driver, not just a nice-to-have. Architectural styles like microservices, process approaches like DevOps, and runtime environments like containers can offer transformational benefits to organizations willing to endure the blizzard of technological options available today.
 
Join us &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/agile/webinar/perfecting-the-software-life-cycle]]&gt; for a discussion with Donnie Berkholz of 451 Research for his perspective on the industry, and a look at some industry trends that are driving the way the world builds software. Pivotal&apos;s Michael Cote will be your host, offering examples of companies that have successfully navigated the buzzword blizzard and transformed the way they build software!
