    <subject>6/7 Webinar - Spring Cloud Stream: What&apos;s New in 2.x—and What&apos;s Next?</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar Spring Cloud Stream: What&apos;s New in 2.x—and What&apos;s Next?, &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/jun-7-spring-cloud-stream-whats-new-in-2-x-and-whats-next-webinar?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=webinars&amp;utm_campaign=spring-cloud-stream-oz&amp;utm_term=q218]]&gt; on June 7, 2018. 

Microservices architecture redefined the concept of a modern application as a set of independent, distributed, and loosely coupled services running in the cloud. Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building these services and connecting them with shared messaging systems. 

In this hands-on session, we’ll look at some of the new features and enhancements that are already part of the 2.0 line, and discuss what we’re working on and what to expect.
