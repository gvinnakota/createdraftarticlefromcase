<p dir="ltr">Colleagues,</p>

<p dir="ltr">I am pleased to announce that we have achieved a major milestone in our journey towards operational independence. Most companies measure major system rollouts in years, but just five months ago a cross-functional team initiated a project to move Pivotal onto our own financial, and people management systems. This past weekend, we launched the first big phase of this&mdash;Workday Financials for our Accounting, Finance, Tax, Procurement, and Accounts Payable teams. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As with any system change of this magnitude, the transition has been an opportunity to streamline and automate more of our business processes. Later this year, we will build upon this work with the launch of Workday people management tools, and a second wave of financial systems. This completely integrated set of tools will give Pivotal new levels of insight and control, which will be critical for our future success.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With any new system, there will be change, and growing pains. The most visible change to our business processes is in our procurement process. If you are a frequent purchaser, please refer to this <a style="color: #059a91; text-decoration: none;" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15WFIycpaWByVYi8IRqkcYo4VP2A-j8b3wQkf49WfsNI/edit">documentation</a>. The procurement process will continue to evolve as we enable more functionality, and we will communicate those changes with stakeholders in a timely manner. Additionally, we have updated Concur to better reflect Pivotal Travel &amp; Expense policies. If you encounter any challenges with Concur, please contact <a style="color: #059a91; text-decoration: none;" href="mailto:travelandexpense@pivotal.io">travelandexpense@pivotal.io</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the day-to-day activities for most of you will not be directly affected by Workday Financials, it will now serve as the backbone of our financial systems. This is a a great example of Pivotal simplifying, taking ownership of, and continually improving, business critical operations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I would like to take this opportunity to thank our Finance and IT team members for partnering closely on this project. It is often said that it takes a village, and that certainly rings true for the teams that have worked diligently to keep this project on pace.</p>
