Hello, I’m Craig. I have responsibility for Dell Tech Global Strategy &amp; Operations here @Pivotal.

 


 



 


 


1. Reflection: SpringOne Platform, Pivotal’s Annual Conference


We are riding the crest of a very inspirational wave from last week in Washington DC. Pivotal’s SpringOne Platform Conference (S1P) was once again outstanding. It is a special feeling when your customers are on stage describing how they are deriving value from your products and methodologies in a way that is moving their business forward in previously unfathomable timeframes. Some of the biggest names in business are ‘at scale’ users of Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Interesting to note how Pivotal Container Service (PKS) is also gaining traction in our existing customer base as well as in new customer adoption. Tons of momentum! See customers share their stories here &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAdzTan_eSPQsR_aqYBQxpYTEQZnjhTN6&amp;disable_polymer=true]]&gt;.


 


 



 


 


2. Opportunity is Contagious!
“An America that asks what it owes its most vulnerable citizens is improved and humane. An America that looks away is ignoring not just the sins of the past but the sins of the present and the certain sins of the future.”
- Ta-Nehisi Coates, American author, journalist, and comic book writer
 
Pivotal held its first “Black@Pivotal” Summit in DC directly following S1P. From around the world, Pivotal employees that share being people of color 
gathered to meet. We held a workshop to discuss ideas on how Pivotal can improve in our quest for Diversity &amp; Inclusion, to give back to the communities from which we came, by laying out a framework to hire from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). We will continue to invest time in volunteer work that drives an immediate impact on the next generation of young black people. Bill Cook, President Pivotal, Inc. and other top execs attended and shared ideas on maintaining our momentum. It is an honor to work for a company that is not just willing but eager to invest in Diversity and Inclusion. 
Most of us stayed an extra day (Saturday) to donate our time with ‘black girls code’, an org dedicated to teaching 1 Million black girls how to code by 2040. With girls ranging in age from 7 - 17 yrs old, this program deeply connects to our shared belief at Pivotal that diversity of thought and background are keys to succeeding in any business, not to mention society at large. To see the look of joy on the faces of girls engaged by strangers that care about them is like nothing else I’ve experienced. Helping two underrepresented members of society at once is good for the soul :)

3. Boeing Shrunk the Earth, Now they will Shrink the Universe 

Boeing’s Ted Colbert, CIO and SVP spoke at SpringOne Platform, discussing parallels between The Jetsons futuristic world (video conferencing, printed food, TV wrist watch, and flying pods) which he watched as a kid, and today. Now as an adult, he is one of many bringing all their crazy ideas to reality; a reality fueled by software. Boeing has enabled people to travel the world, and now, with the help of software and partnership with Pivotal, they are creating transportation beyond Earth. Watch his talk below:

4. Mission impossible: Build a Startup within a Bureaucracy


The creativity and innovation percolating out of US Air Force’s lab in Boston is endlessly impressive. What’s striking is how the USAF engineers seem to have uncanny marketing skills, better than most brand professionals. Bryon Kroger, COO of Kessel Run &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMLjVRMPHMQ]]&gt; must have LOVED standing on stage in front of 3,000 while coining the phrase #makeSHIPeasy and #agileAF. Saving millions of dollars on a daily basis seems to fuel creativity beyond software design as they’ve successfully built a startup within an inherently bureaucratic government organization.

We hope the work Pivotal is doing with USAF will be a catalyst for improving other departments within the DoD. Eliminating mistakes by modernizing communication processes and building agile software to create more seamless, less bureaucratic decision making enables effective operations which protect innocent lives, and forwards the mission for the right to Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.


 


 



 


 


5. Digital Transformation Does Not Happen without Hardware. Period. 


Developers normally aren’t concerned with infrastructure, the only thing that matters, is that it works. For the ‘better together’ solution which enables DBS Bank’s 22,000 people to operate like a startup and USAF’s $1M savings per day to become reality, hardware infrastructure being seamless and operationally ‘invisible’ is important. 
Software needs hardware to run and as a greater Dell Tech team, we are here to help you run, and run fast. The secret is Pivotal Ready Architecture, the &apos;Easy Button’ for deploying PCF or PKS on-premises. Recent PRA win: McDonald&apos;s China and Chow Sang Sang &lt;[[https://www.chowsangsang.com/]]&gt;, China’s largest jewelry retailer invested $200k on PKS and $800k on Dell EMC and VMware infrastructure and services.
