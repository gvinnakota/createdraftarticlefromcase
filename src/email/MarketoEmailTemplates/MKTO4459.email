<p dir="ltr">Colleagues,</p>
<p dir="ltr">Beginning February 4, 2017, Pivotal will transition from our current Calendar Year (CY), which ends on December 31, to a new Fiscal Year (FY) based on a 4&ndash;4&ndash;5 model. Converting to this new FY will synchronize our financial reporting, business processes, and sales cycles with Dell Technologies' Fiscal Year, and will help us maintain operational efficiencies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Our current year follows the calendar, running from January 1 to December 31, with four quarters of three months each. Pivotal&rsquo;s new 4&ndash;4&ndash;5 FY will also have four quarters, but each quarter will consist of one four-week period, a second four-week period, and a final five-week period.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On February 4, 2017, the FY2018 will begin, and will be structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Q1 FY2018: February 4 &ndash; May 5, 2017   
<ul>
<li>Period 1: (4 Weeks) February 4 &ndash; March 3, 2017</li>
<li>Period 2: (4 Weeks) March 4 &ndash; March 31, 2017</li>
<li>Period 3: (5 Weeks) April 1 &ndash; May 5, 2017</li>
</ul>
