    <subject>Diversity and Inclusion at Pivotal</subject>
    <textOnly>Colleagues,

We know intuitively that diversity and inclusion matters. It’s something we care about deeply, and defines who we are as a company. From our conversations with many of you, it’s clear everyone feels the same way.

Diversity is about perspective—it’s about being open to the idea that people of different backgrounds and experiences bring great value to organizations. The ability to work with people unlike you starts with curiosity, which is the basis for great innovation.

As a result, Diversity and Inclusion (D&amp;I) is one of the primary sources of innovation, and it fosters a collaborative work environment. Most importantly, it reflects our values—Do What Works, Do The Right Thing, Be Kind—and it’s something we need to consistently practice, and doggedly protect.

We’re therefore pleased to begin sharing what we and others in the company have been working on around D&amp;I. We also invite you to join or support the growing number of D&amp;I activities.

We’re excited to launch the Diversity &amp; Inclusion &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/departments/human-resources/diversity-inclusion]]&gt; page on Inside Pivotal, which highlights many of the activities and events taking place across the company, with details on how to get involved.

Here are some of the things that have taken place this year or are coming soon:


 - Formed a Diversity Council &lt;[[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k5KgYM_ermfIlPcyHwwapts5-ULiEEPqJ7ewJN7EQ5s/edit#slide=id.gcc5ac8133_0_29]]&gt; to foster diversity and inclusion at Pivotal
 - Partnered with Watermark &lt;[[https://www.wearewatermark.org/]]&gt;, an organization helping advance women in the workplace
 - Created an active #diversity Slack channel with over 150 members. Join us!
 - Hosted “Girls Who Code” field trip in San Francisco—Read the blog post! &lt;[[https://blog.pivotal.io/labs/features/pivotal-girls-who-code-event-inspires-women-to-work-in-it]]&gt;
 - Sponsored a Watermark Speaker event in Palo Alto, with author Lindsay McGregor &lt;[[https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsaymcgregor]]&gt;
 - Pledged to sponsor Women Transforming Technology &lt;[[http://www.womentransformingtechnology.com/]]&gt; in February 2016—a by-women-for-women in tech conference in the Bay Area. If you’re local and interested in attending this conference please visit Inside Pivotal to get your tickets! We have a limited number available for employees.
 - In 2016, we will be partnering with #YesWeCode &lt;[[http://www.yeswecode.org/]]&gt;, a nonprofit focusing on teaching coding to 100,000 individuals from low-opportunity backgrounds, by extending paid apprenticeships in various Pivotal offices in the US.
 - We’re also in the process of analyzing our data on workforce diversity. We’ll review that with the executive leadership and our Diversity Council, and we’ll subsequently release the data in early 2016.



Finally, inclusion is a collective responsibility, and we encourage you to join your colleagues on doing what works, doing the right thing, and being kind. Here are some ways to get involved:


 - Join the #diversity conversation on Slack.
 - Do something grassroots. Don’t ask for permission—do something you are passionate about, and get others involved.
 - Check out the new Diversity &amp; Inclusion &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/departments/human-resources/diversity-inclusion]]&gt; page on Inside Pivotal.
 - Reach out to a member of the D&amp;I council &lt;[[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k5KgYM_ermfIlPcyHwwapts5-ULiEEPqJ7ewJN7EQ5s/edit#slide=id.gcc5ac8133_0_29]]&gt; or HR team member with ideas or for advice.



Thank you for helping make our company a special place to work.
