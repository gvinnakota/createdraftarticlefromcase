    <subject>4/25/17 Webinar: Session State Caching with Spring</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar, Session State Caching with Spring &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/apr-25-session-state-caching-with-spring-webinar?utm_source=digest&amp;utm_medium=webinars&amp;utm_campaign=session-state-caching&amp;utm_term=q218]]&gt; on April 25, 2018. 

Caching is a common and effective pattern for scaling applications in near real-time to handle increased load and demand. This is particularly important for cloud-native applications that serve a multitude of users, devices and even other applications. Caching can be applied in several tiers of the application and (HTTP) session state is no exception. 

Spring Session offers a robust yet portable solution that avoids container lock-in without sacrificing robust features like clustering. It seamlessly allows you to plug in different provider implementations—including Spring Session for Apache Geode—to cluster session state in 
a reliable, consistent, and scalable manner. 

Following this webinar, you will understand how session state caching using Spring Session with Apache Geode provides a reliable experience to end-users—one that is resilient to system failures, constant reconfiguration and continuous changes, in both the underlying infrastructure and applications as they evolve.
