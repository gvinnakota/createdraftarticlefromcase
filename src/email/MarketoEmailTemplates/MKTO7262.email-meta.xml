    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

I would like to invite you to a breakfast Pivotal are hosting in Melbourne on the 2nd April on the topic of Driving Innovation with Application Transformation. While organisations are placing priority on driving business innovation, this effort is often hindered by outdated platforms, antiquated tools and lengthy processes.

At this event you will hear from Lawrence Crowther, CTO APJ, Pivotal and Charles Dagher, Manager Digital Systems, Toyota Australia on why your organisation needs application transformation in order to truly drive innovation within your business, as well as the key AppTx principles to modernise your application portfolio.

Registration opens at 8:00am, with the formalities commencing from 8:30am and wrap up at 10:15am.

We look forward to seeing you there.

Regards,
