    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

We’re sorry you were unable to attend the Cloud Native Workshop in St. Louis on December 10th.

Workshop attendees got hands-on experience using Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Spring, and we invite you to do the same. Visit run.pivotal.io &lt;[[http://run.pivotal.io/]]&gt; to try Pivotal Web Services - simply upload your files and your app just works! Additionally, we’ve made the workshop presentations available here &lt;[[https://github.com/cbusch-pivotal/SpringCloudWorkshop]]&gt; so you can catch up on what you missed.

Interested in learning more what being Cloud Native can do for your organization? Contact us &lt;[[mailto:block@pivotal.io]]&gt; to schedule a technical evaluation with our team.

For upcoming events visit us at Pivotal.io &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/news-events]]&gt; and select the events tab. We look forward to seeing you soon!
