    <subject>The Subscription Club is All Set!</subject>
    <textOnly>Team,

In August we announced a new second-half SPIF to drive subscription sales. If you achieve your second-half quota for subscription software, you&apos;ll become part of the &quot;Subscription Club,&quot; which earns you and your partner an awesome weekend adventure with top Pivotal salespeople from around the world.

I&apos;m excited to announce the Subscription Club venue 
and time. This three-day, two-night adventure will take place on May 21—24 2016, at the W Hotel &lt;http://www.starwoodhotels.com/whotels/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=1599&amp;language=en_US&gt; in South Beach, Miami, 
Florida—otherwise known as the American Riviera (with its long stretches of pristine beaches).

You may have noticed that the Subscription Club dates are adjacent to the Pivotal Club, which takes place the following week in Puerto Rico. That&apos;s intentional. If you achieve both your second-half software quota and qualify for Pivotal Club, you and your partner will enjoy a full week of sun and fun in Miami and Puerto Rico.

We took a quick look at those of you in the running for the Subscription Club, and the current tally stands at more than 50 people (see chart below). Calculations are based on 3rd-quarter actuals, plus 25% of the pipeline for the 2nd-half. We included anyone that is &gt;70%. Note: Your subscription goal is the software threshold for your second half total goal, 50% of your second half goal in Americas, and 70% in EMEA and APJ.

We&apos;ll post the leaderboard periodically, so get your deals rolling, and let&apos;s get more of you on the board for both the Subscription Club and Pivotal Club!
