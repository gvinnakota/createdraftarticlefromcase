    <subject>Webinar: Publish, Secure and Monitor APIs with Pivotal Cloud Foundry Route Services</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/apis-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-route-services]]&gt;
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

 Join Pivotal and Apigee &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/apis-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-route-services]]&gt; to learn about Route Services in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) 1.7, on Wednesday, May 11, 2016. 

Route Services make it possible for developers to transform or process network level requests before they reach an application. Operators gain the ability to offer their developers a curated, self-service, menu of route services, deflecting one-off requests. And Route Services are designed with APIs in mind, making it easy to add security, authentication and caching to requests. 

Learn from Apigee&apos;s experience &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/apis-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-route-services]]&gt; building one of the first Service Brokers to leverage route services! You’ll walk away with some powerful insights about how to build and deploy a 
full-featured API management platform as a route service and learn how to use Apigee features including, quota enforcement, spike arrests and content caching.
