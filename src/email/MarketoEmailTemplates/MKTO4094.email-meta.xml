    <subject>Distribution of New Pivotal ID Badges</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi All, 

 We currently leverage EMC for our office access systemsâ€”essentially the ID badges and badge readers that allow us to access and gain entrance to our offices. The Dell/EMC merger, which we expect to close in the coming weeks, will require a change in these access systems and the need for everyone who has a Pivotal photo ID badge to receive a new Pivotal ID badge. 

 This process will start next week, August 29th. 





 - 
New Pivotal badges will be mailed to each Pivotal office, and your local concierge team will alert you when they&apos;re ready for pick-up. For offices without concierges, a designated local site administrator will receive and distribute the badges.






 - 
Your concierge/local administrator will contact you to distribute your new Pivotal badge. If you work from a home office, your new badge will be sent to your home address.






 - 
The new Pivotal badges will not be immediately active, so please keep and use your current badge until notified. We&apos;ll issue a memo to all of Pivotal to advise you when the new badges will become active.






 - 
Once the new Pivotal badges are activated, you&apos;ll be asked to return your old badge to your concierge administrator.






 - 
Again, if your current badge does not have your photo on it, no action is required. 




A small fraction of Pivotal employees work out of EMC buildings and also have EMC badges. We&apos;re working with EMC to distribute to these individuals new Dell/EMC badges. 

 If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your manager, or open a ticket at ask@pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:ask@pivotal.io]]&gt;
