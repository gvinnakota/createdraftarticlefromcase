    <subject>2/14 Webinar: Driving Better Customer Experiences in Mobile Network Services</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/14883/238537?utm_source=Pivotal&amp;utm_medium=brighttalk&amp;utm_campaign=238537]]&gt;
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Innovative mobile service operators are searching for new ways to exploit data to better serve their customers and drive new revenue opportunities. But pulling together data scattered across legacy transactional and BI systems is difficult and slow. Worse, these systems were not designed to analyze the volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data exhaust from user plane and control plane traffic. However, this data offers the potential for deep, integrated insights for operational, customer care and marketing needs. 

 Join Pivotal and Hortonworks &lt;[[http://hortonworks.com/webinar/mobile-operators-use-advanced-analytics-better-customer-experience/?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=text-link&amp;utm_campaign=hortonworks webinar_Q117]]&gt; for a live 45 minute webinar where they&apos;ll discuss mobile operator challenges in network 
operations, customer care, and marketing, and how Hortonworks HDB’s in-database analytics enable operators to deliver better customer experiences. In this webinar, you’ll learn:

 - How market headwinds are affecting operators’ ability to grow revenue. 
 - How data from clickstreams and flows can be mined to assist in problem resolution and to identify subscribers likely to respond to marketing treatments. 
 - Real-life examples of operators who used HDB to deliver better customer experiences.
