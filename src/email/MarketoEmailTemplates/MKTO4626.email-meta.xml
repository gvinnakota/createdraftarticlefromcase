Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Thank you for your participation in our 2016 Geode Summit.


 In 2017, we will be consolidating our conference sessions and including Geode as a track at SpringOne Platform, taking place Dec 4-7, 2017 &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=geode-at-springone]]&gt; in San Francisco. This gives us the ability to offer an expanded agenda with more sessions related to these topics. This also gives you access to all Spring sessions that are of interest to data professionals. 

 In addition to attending, we encourage you to present at the event and share your experiences with Geode. A call for papers will be sent out in the near term so keep an eye out. 

 We hope to see you there! 

 Thank you, 
 The SpringOne Platform Team</textOnly>
