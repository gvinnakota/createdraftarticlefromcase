    <textOnly>Hello,
 
 Thank you for stopping by the Pivotal booth at last week’s O’Reilly Security Conference.

Security is now a CEO priority. You face new threats, while still dealing with the old ones. Pivotal offers an innovative approach to security that emphasizes faster software delivery, and faster changes to the underlying infrastructure. The “3 R’s of cloud-native security” (repair/rotate/repave) are a reality, and changing how enterprises operate.

Until we meet again here &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/oreilly-security-conference?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=global-event-oreilly-security-conference-q417]]&gt; are some resources to dig into.


	- Cloud-Native Security
	- White Paper on Security and Compliance with PCF
	- Strategies on How to Overcome Security Challenges Unique to Cloud-Native Apps
	- Cloud-Native Security: Rotate, Repair, Repave — Justin Smith from SpringOne Platform 2016
