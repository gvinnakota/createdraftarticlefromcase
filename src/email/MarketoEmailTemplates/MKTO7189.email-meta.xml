These are Java developer community events that will bring the best Cloud-Native java content from our flagship conference directly to you. If you are working on a Spring application, you&apos;ll have the opportunity to learn from and share with members of the Spring community &lt;[[https://springonetour.io/2019/speakers?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=e1-s1t-spring-community-default]]&gt;. 


Over the course of two days, you’ll see the latest technology and participate in open discussions about all things Spring. You will also hear about related technologies like Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry, Concourse, and RabbitMQ too.
