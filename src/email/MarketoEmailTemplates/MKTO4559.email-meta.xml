    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 
 We invite you to download the O’Reilly eBook: Cloud-Native Java: Designing Resilient Systems with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Cloud Foundry, authored by Pivotal’s Josh Long and Kenny Bastani. 

 In four content-packed chapters, you will learn:

 - How to get started with Spring Initializr, the Spring Tool Suite, and the Spring Guides 
 - The patterns, scalability, reliability, and agility of a cloud-native platform and cloud-native applications 
 - About event-driven architectures with Spring Integration, and how Spring Cloud Stream makes it easy to define channels that are connected to messaging technologies 
 - Why Spring Batch has become a widely used industry standard to support processing large volumes of records on the JVM

 By utilizing the tools and frameworks described in this free eBook, you will discover how Spring and Cloud Foundry make it easy to build cloud-native applications that create differentiated business value. 

 The final eBook is expected to publish in April 2017, so take advantage of your only opportunity to get a first look, compliments of Pivotal, before it becomes widely available.
