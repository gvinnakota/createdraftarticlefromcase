Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 
 Join John Rymer, Vice President, Forrester Research and Richard Seroter, Sr. Director, Pivotal, to help you figure out how your existing application portfolio fits in your digital transformation. 

Digital transformation is not just about building new applications, but also about unlocking the value in the existing ones. To unlock that value, these applications often need some level of modernization. But how much is enough? What types of applications require the most changes? Can you just lift-and-shift applications into the latest container platform and call it done? These tough questions are critical to your long-term success. 

 Forrester Research has uncovered five common approaches to application modernization: lift-and-shift, lift-and-extend, SaaS substitution, full replacement, and hybrid extend. In this webinar featuring John Rymer of Forrester, and Richard Seroter of Pivotal, you will learn about these five approaches and the benefits and risks of each. We will discuss how to profile your existing application portfolio to identify which applications are the right fit for each modernization approach.
