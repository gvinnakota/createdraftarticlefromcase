    <textOnly>Understanding microservice latency: An introduction to Distributed Tracing and Zipkin
Speakers: Adrian Cole &amp; Marcin Grzejszczak, Pivotal



Latency analysis is the act of blaming components for causing user perceptible delay. In today&apos;s world of microservices, this can be tricky as requests can fan out across polyglot components and even data-centers. In many cases, the root source of latency isn&apos;t a component, but rather a link between components. This session will overview how to debug latency problems, using call graphs created by Zipkin.



We&apos;ll use trace zipkin itself, setting up from scratch using docker. While we&apos;re at it, we&apos;ll discuss how the model works, and how to safely trace production. Finally, we&apos;ll overview the ecosystem, including tools to trace ruby, c#, java and spring boot apps. When you leave, you&apos;ll at least know something about distributed tracing, and hopefully be on your way to blaming things for causing latency!
