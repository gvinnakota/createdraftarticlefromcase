    <subject>Welcome to Pivotal</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name}},
 
 I’m delighted to welcome you to Pivotal. You represent the next class of Pivots—exceptionally talented individuals joining our mission to transform how the world builds software. Most of the world still builds software in a traditional and rigid way. Pivotal&apos;s approach offers something different: an opinionated, modern and sustainable way to build software.
 
 You will be surrounded by people who are at the pinnacle of their chosen professions, working as a single community on a singular mission.
 
 I leave you with a simple set of values that motivates all of us at Pivotal. Do what’s right, do what works, and be kind.
 
 Welcome to Pivotal.
