Hello, I’m Jag. I run Business Intelligence &amp; Analytics for the Dell Tech Alliances team at Pivotal. On a daily basis I leverage data to answer pressing questions regarding joint opportunities across Pivotal and the Dell family of companies, primarily DellEMC and VMware.

 


 



 


 


1. The Simplest and Fastest Way to get educated on Pivotal


Do you want to take a deeper dive into Pivotal’s mission, what our customers say about us and our future aspirations? If yes, then definitely check out our YouTube channel &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzd8R3vkpllD4CJn_5g5sKg]]&gt;. When I started onboarding at Pivotal about 6 months back I found our resources to be extremely helpful in terms of understanding the big picture.  And for Dell Tech dedicated resources, see Pivotal Pulse &lt;[[https://partners.pivotal.io/English/General_DT_Info.aspx]]&gt;.

 


 



 


 


2. Using Data to Quantify “Digital Transformation”

We all know that digital transformation is the common buzzword these days. However, there isn’t much talk about how to measure and quantify a customer’s digital transformation journey. Our SVP of Services &amp; Customer Success, Edward Hieatt, provides a great &quot;5 S framework &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/announcements/the-built-to-adapt-benchmark-will-help-companies-to-set-a-new-course]]&gt;&quot; that can be used as a simple way of beginning to measure the progress your customers are 
making based on the solutions you helped them deploy.

 


 



 


 

3. Are pretty dashboards always effective? 

My answer: “It Depends.”
Playing with financial data for the past few years there’s simply been too many times when me or my teammates have made amazing looking dashboards that were circulated among stakeholders to start things off but ultimately fizzed out due to input data quality issues, limited agility, etc. I want to introduce you a framework that can be leveraged to maximize the chances of creating a dashboard that will be organized and well-received.

The framework is called INSIGHT. Each letter represents a concept. They are Identify Question, Name KPIs, Shape Data, Initial Concept, Gather Feedback, Hone Dashboard, and Tell the story. 


 


 



 


 


4. Two Shining Jewels of the Pivotal - Dell Tech Family Joint Offering Portfolio 


At Pivotal, PRA and PKS are two critical components of the Dell family better together vision and story. Everyday, we work tirelessly to realize our vision of an integrated Dell family stack from the application layer all the way down to the hardware appliance layer. To learn more about PKS and PRA and how they drive hyper-converged infrastructure, NSX-t and vSphere. Check out the official Pivotal Dell Tech PKS &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/partners/vmware/pivotal-container-service]]&gt; and PRA &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/pivotal-ready-architecture]]&gt; pages.


 


 



 


 


5. Dell Tech Stories - Michael Dell on Guy Raz’s How I Built This 


I recently came across this podcast where I learned about Michael’s incredible success story brewed over more than 3 decades. From selling newspapers to transforming the world of IT forever, learn about Michael’s incredible personal journey by listening here &lt;[[https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=580851735]]&gt;. Truly inspirational.




Have a great weekend!
Jag
