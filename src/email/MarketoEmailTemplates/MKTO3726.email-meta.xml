    <textOnly>Data Microservices with Spring Cloud Data Flow
Speakers: Mark Fisher &amp; Mark Pollack, Pivotal



The future of scalable data processing is microservices! Building on the ease of development and deployment provided by Spring Boot and the cloud native capabilities of Spring Cloud, the Spring Cloud Stream and Spring Cloud Task projects provide a simple and powerful framework for microservice stream and batch processing.



At a higher level of abstraction, Spring Cloud Data Flow is an integrated orchestration layer that provides a highly productive experience for deploying and managing sophisticated data pipelines consisting of standalone microservices. Streams and tasks are defined using a DSL abstraction and can be managed via shell and a web UI. Furthermore, a pluggable runtime SPI allows Spring Cloud Data Flow to coordinate these applications across a variety of distributed runtime platforms such as Cloud Foundry, Apache Mesos and Apache YARN.



During this webinar you&apos;ll see an overview of Spring Cloud Data Flow, with live demos of streaming and batch apps, on different platforms ranging from local cluster to a remote Cloud to show the simplicity of the developer experience.

Understanding microservice latency: An introduction to Distributed Tracing and Zipkin
Speakers: Adrian Cole &amp; Marcin Grzejszczak, Pivotal



Latency analysis is the act of blaming components for causing user perceptible delay. In today&apos;s world of microservices, this can be tricky as requests can fan out across polyglot components and even data-centers. In many cases, the root source of latency isn&apos;t a component, but rather a link between components. This session will overview how to debug latency problems, using call graphs created by Zipkin. We&apos;ll use trace zipkin itself, setting up from scratch using docker.

While we&apos;re at it, we&apos;ll discuss how the model works, and how to safely trace production. Finally, we&apos;ll overview the ecosystem, including tools to trace ruby, c#, java and spring boot apps. When you leave, you&apos;ll at least know something about distributed tracing, and hopefully be on your way to blaming things for causing latency!
