    <textOnly>Hi gang,

This is a reminder for you (and your significant 
other) about the great Club trips that we have lined up for those who meet their quarterly and annual targets.

We’re in full swing planning these memorable Club experiences. As always, let me and the executive team know how we can help you close your engagements for the quarter so you can join your colleagues at some amazing venues. 

Subscription Club 2016—Miami, May 20–23, 2016



 - We look forward to welcoming you at the “W” hotel &lt;http://www.wsouthbeach.com/&gt; from May 20–23, 2016.  

 - The W’s Miami Club is in the heart of Miami’s South Beach. This will be an unforgettable experience in a cutting-edge oasis, where the sun is bright, and the beaches are inviting. You’ll kick off your shoes, and sink your toes into the sand at this vibrant paradise.
 



Achievement Club 2016—Puerto Rico, May 23–26, 2016



 - Our location is the luxurious The St. Regis Bahia Beach in Puerto Rico &lt;http://www.stregisbahiabeach.com/&gt;.
 - Pleasure is a daily mantra, where you can savor local flavors, indulge your senses, and get a taste of adventure. Or simply bask on the pristine Bahia Beach.


We’re on our way to closing a remarkable year, so finish strong. Let me know if you have any questions, and I hope to see you at these great events!</textOnly>
