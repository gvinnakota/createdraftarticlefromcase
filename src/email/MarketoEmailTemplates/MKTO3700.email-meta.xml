    <subject>Phishing and Scamsâ€”Please Stay Vigilant!</subject>
    <textOnly>All, 

Due in part to the recent uptick of Pivotal in the news, we are seeing an increase in the number of phishing scams, social engineering emails, and other attempts to obtain sensitive information. Methods for obtaining information in this way are continuously changing, and we need your continued vigilance to ensure we safeguard Pivotal from attacks. 

 Please keep in mind the following:


 - Be wary of anyone calling and claiming to represent law enforcement or government official. Always ask for contact information (e.g., call back information) and refer them to your manager. Neither Pivotal nor any of our providers will initiate contact by telephone, email, fax, or any social media tools to request your personal or financial information. 
 - Never click on an unknown link or respond to a suspicious looking email. 
 - Critically examine your emails and ask yourself: Is this valid? 



If you are asked to send sensitive information, take the following steps before sending:


 - Ask yourself why this person would ask me to send sensitive information by email. Does it make sense?  
 - Make sure the &quot;To,&quot; &quot;From,&quot; and &quot;CC&quot; lines of the emails are valid. Are there any mismatches between the &quot;From&quot; and the &quot;Reply-To&quot; addresses? In Gmail, click on the dropdown next to the email address or highlight the email address to see more information on the recipient. 
 - Check if the word &quot;via&quot; is next to the sender&apos;s name. This is an indication that the email is from a different sender and could be fraudulent. 



If you are unsure about the validity of an email, stop and ask your manager and/or information security (infosec@pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:infosec@pivotal.io]]&gt;) for help.
