    <subject>Diversity—It’s Up to Us</subject>
    <textOnly>Team,

One of the most energizing and inspiring moments at our 2016 Pivotal Worldwide Kickoff event was Cornelia Davis’ keynote on Diversity &amp; Inclusion; highlights of which can be viewed here &lt;[[https://drive.google.com/a/pivotal.io/file/d/0B-1qhMs7y09eQV92VGlNeDQ0TUU/view?usp=sharing]]&gt;.

Diversity makes Pivotal a better company; it makes everybody feel part of something bigger than ourselves. Ultimately, it strengthens our bonds of community as we collectively transform how the world builds software. Cornelia’s keynote is really just an expression of this broader issue—are we making sure that everybody is getting a fair shot to join us on this important mission?

When the answer to that question is “no” or “we can do more,” then we—the leadership team and every employee—bear the responsibility to change the narrative and do something to influence the outcome.

What we collectively decide to do next can either strengthen and unite us, or weaken and divide us. Each one of you must decide. My view—and that of leadership team—is that gender and ethnic diversity is, unequivocally, not just the right thing, but essential to accomplishing our aspirational mission and to pushing Pivotal into hyper growth.

Make no mistake—this is a business problem. Everyone in the industry is struggling to hire  &lt;[[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/19/technology/unicorns-hunt-for-talent-among-silicon-valleys-giants.html]]&gt;great talent, and not maximizing half of the talent pool (e.g., women) is a 
tremendous opportunity. Moreover, research suggests diverse teams make better decisions &lt;[[http://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/better_decisions_through_diversity]]&gt; and, ultimately, greater profits, so we can continue building transformative 
software that transforms our customers.

Cornelia Davis will send out a note shortly on behalf of the Diversity Council, a group of passionate individuals that have committed their time to showing all of us how we can get more involved.

I encourage everyone to commit to 
one (or more) of the great ideas and initiatives that they have started.</textOnly>
