    <subject>Thank You for Joining Pivotal at JavaOne 2016</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello,

 Thank you for joining Pivotal and the Spring community at JavaOne &lt;[[https://www.oracle.com/javaone/]]&gt;. Hopefully you learned how enterprises are adopting Cloud Native application architectures to drive modern software experiences for their customers. If you’d like to arrange a hands on workshop at your offices or at a nearby hotel, simply inquire here &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/cloud-native-workshop]]&gt;. 

 In the meantime, start your Cloud Native journey to learn why it matters and what it looks like to become Cloud Native right here &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/cloud-native]]&gt;. Get started &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry]]&gt; with Pivotal Cloud Foundry by deploying an app in a matter of minutes. And remember to pick up your free copy of the O’Reilly eBook, Migrating to Cloud Native Applications &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform/migrating-to-cloud-native-application-architectures-ebook]]&gt;.
