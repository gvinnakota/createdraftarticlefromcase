    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
Today, I’m excited to share that Pivotal Software is now a public company on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: PVTL).

Since Pivotal’s founding, we’ve worked toward an ambitious mission—to transform how the world builds software—and we’ve now passed an important milestone in our journey. Getting here has been both exciting and challenging, and we couldn’t have done it without our customers, our partners, and our Pivots.
Pivotal believes that businesses across every industry need to innovate at the speed of startups to succeed in a world increasingly defined by software. We are privileged to work with the world’s largest enterprises to help them transform how they use technology. In turn, these companies will create software that enriches the lives of their customers—and change the world.

When I watch our customers deploy their most important applications to Pivotal Cloud Foundry, or take an idea on a Monday and build working software by Friday, it’s apparent that Pivots are the custodians of something important: building a platform and sharing a methodology that enables our customers to transform their future.



On this special day, thank you to our many forward-thinking customers, especially those that risked their reputations and made big bets on Pivotal. You brought an ambitious vision of transformation to your companies by embracing software as a core competency in every part of your business. You challenged us to do our best work. Together, we’ve discovered new ways to engage your customers and reshape entire industries.

Thank you to the hundreds of partners that have joined us to build the Pivotal ecosystem. By partnering closely with leaders in Cloud Infrastructure, Systems Integration, and third-party software companies, we are delivering on our promises of multi-cloud developer productivity, operational efficiency, and security. I&apos;d also like to extend a special thank you to the open-source community of developers across Cloud Foundry, Spring, RabbitMQ, Greenplum, and Apache Geode.

Finally, over the past five years, I’ve witnessed Pivots around the globe teach and learn from each other, while demonstrating our values—do the right thing, do what works, and be kind—at every turn. All of you make me proud.

Going public is a major step for Pivotal; however, it will not change who we are, how we work, or our mission. Today is a special day, but it’s in the many days ahead that we will define the impact our company leaves on our customers and the world.

Thank you to our customers and partners, and congratulations to all Pivots.
Rob
