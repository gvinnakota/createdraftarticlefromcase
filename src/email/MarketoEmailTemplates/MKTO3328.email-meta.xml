Hear from the Digital Transformation Office (DTO)

Learn about how they have adopted a cloud native approach from Lindsay Holmwood, Infrastructure and Platforms Lead

The ability to deliver software has now become a critical requirement for survival in todayâ€™s business world.
 
 Companies need to build better software faster to compete. Can your development team move from an idea to production in one motion - in a matter of weeks or days?
 
 Existing monolithic applications, legacy platforms and lengthy operational deployment cycles are holding innovation back. Learn how companies are removing the innovation barrier by moving to a cloud native approach for the software delivery lifecycle.
 
 Join us and learn how companies are deploying software in weeks vs. months using a Cloud Native platform.


At this event, you will learn:

 - What a Cloud Native architecture is and the patterns of high performing organisations that deliver software faster, consistently and reliably at scale.
 - What Microservices are and how a Microservice Architecture enables speed, safety and scalability
 - How Continuous Delivery and DevOps drives innovation cycles
 - How to use a Cloud Native platform to facilitate operational agility
 - How to modernise the application portfolio
