Introducing Spring Security 3.2
Spring Security has evolved for over ten years to protect against the latest security threats. The latest release of Spring Security 3.2 is no exception bringing: CSRF protection, Clickjacking protection, Java Configuration support, optional Spring MVC integration, Servlet 3 and Servlet 3.1 integration and concurrency support. To learn more take a look at What’s new in Spring Security 3.2 &lt;http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.2.x/reference/htmlsingle/&gt; and the new guides &lt;http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.2.x/guides/&gt;. Also stay tuned to http://spring.io/videos &lt;http://spring.io/videos&gt; to see the Spring Security 3.2 
Webinar replay.

Improved Generics-Aware Dependency Injection in Spring Framework 4
Spring 4 is out and without come a bevy of great new features. One such feature is generics-aware dependency injection, which Phil Webb elaborates on in this great blog post. The main takeaway is that you can disambiguate types by their generic component for dependency resolution. Thus: 

@Autowired 

 public void setFeedService(FeedService&lt;AtomEntry&gt; atomFeedService){

 ...


Is distinct from:

@Autowired

 public void setFeedService(FeedService&lt;RssEntry&gt; rssFeedService){

 ...
Optimize your JVM settings for Spring Tool Suite
We ship the Spring Tool Suite with settings that provide a good starting point for all our users. That might work for everybody, but might not provide the best setting for each situation. The good news is: you can change those settings yourself. Take a look at the sts.ini file. It is located alongside the executable (on OSX you need to take a look inside the STS.app package under Contents/MacOS).

The file contains a number of settings for STS and Eclipse in general, but it lists the JVM options at the end - one setting per line. There you can add your own settings or change existing ones. A more comprehensive discussion about which settings to choose can be found in our forum here. Don’t forget to save a backup of that file - just in case something goes wrong... :-)
Intro to Apache Tomcat 8
Speakers: Daniel Mikusa and Stuart Williams

Apache Tomcat 8 implements new versions of the Servlet, JSP and EL specifications as well as adding support for the new WebSocket specification. Work has also been completed on internal refactoring in a number of areas that will impact a number of Tomcat specific features.

This presentation will provide an overview of the changes and new features introduced by both the updated specifications and the Tomcat specific changes. This session will enable attendees to identify the Tomcat 8 features of greatest interest to them and provide them with the information required to start planning their migration to Tomcat 8.

Spring Data Repositories – Best Practices
Speakers: Oliver Gierke and Thomas Darimont

The repository abstraction layer is one of the core pieces of the Spring Data projects. It provides a consistent, interface-based programming model to allow implementing data access layers easily for relational and NoSQL databases.

We will have a look at the lessons learned from the application of it in various customer projects and summarize best practices for you to apply in your projects. The session will also discuss advanced features like the Querydsl integration, the integration of custom implementation code as well as hooks into Spring MVC and Spring HATEOAS.
