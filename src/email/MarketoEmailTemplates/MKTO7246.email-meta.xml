    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=}},
It was great to see you in Amsterdam at SpringOne Tour. If you want the presentation content you will find it here &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/springone-tour-amsterdam-2019]]&gt;. If you enjoyed the event you can also schedule an onsite workshop &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/cloud-native-workshop]]&gt; for your organization.
And be sure to join us this October in Austin, Texas for SpringOne
