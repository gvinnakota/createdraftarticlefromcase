    <subject>Save the date for modern data architecture sessions at SpringOne Platform 2017</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello,

2016 was a bang up year for conference sessions related to modern data architectures using in-memory data grids.


 - The Geode Summit event &lt;[[https://2016.event.geodesummit.com/schedule?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=SpringOnePlatform2017]]&gt;, focused on the open source in-memory data grid product, was well attended with active participation from 20+ presenters 
 - At last year&apos;s SpringOne Platform conference &lt;[[http://spr.ly/S1P2016?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=text-link&amp;utm_campaign=SpringOnePlatform2017]]&gt;, sessions related to GemFire, our in-memory data grid product based on Geode, and our in-memory data services for Pivotal Cloud Foundry, were all well attended

 In 2017, we will be consolidating our conference sessions and focusing our efforts around the SpringOne Platform conference in San Francisco (Dec 4th to Dec 7th) &lt;[[http://springoneplatform.io/?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=SpringOnePlatform2017]]&gt;. This gives us the ability to offer an expanded agenda with more sessions related to these topics. This also gives you access to all the other Spring Framework sessions that are of interest to data professionals. We hope to see you there!

 Sincerely, 
The SpringOne Platform Team</textOnly>
