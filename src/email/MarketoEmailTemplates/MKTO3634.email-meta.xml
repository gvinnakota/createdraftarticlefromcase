 Code + Friends
 Steve Casale &lt;[[https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1033819-stephencasale]]&gt;, Sr. Manager, Corporate Communications
At one dramatic point in The Martian &lt;[[http://www.amazon.com/Martian-Andy-Weir/dp/0553418025]]&gt;, the abandoned but resourceful botanist Matt Watney uncovers a NASA rover buried in Mars’ amber sands, and uses the vehicle to subsequently reconnect with his comrades back on Earth. Re-establishing bonds with others proved to be as important as his ingenuity (and some intense orbital mechanics) in helping him survive on and eventually leave Mars. 

Software change is a bit like that. It requires courage to clear the sands of documentation and protections that accumulate against risk, and rediscover the artifacts of success. You need friends too. As Kent Beck &lt;[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67833.Extreme_Programming_Explained]]&gt; famously put it, good software takes good technique and good relationships. 

This issue is peppered with examples of technique and human connection. From the East coast we get two miniatures on craft—the elements of a useful user story from Heddy Stern, and a thoughtful piece on how test-driven design helps one developer transcend ADD (attention deficit disorder). Nick Cayou and Josh McKenty give us the state of cloud partnerships—a terrific and very “human build” of hard work and influence, while CFO Robert O’Donovan connects the dots on a solid quarter in our Business Update.

All the pieces of technique and relationships are coming together in our SpringOne Platform &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/corporate-marketing/events/springone-platform-2016]]&gt; event, and our Cloud Native roadshows &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/corporate-marketing/events/pivotal-roadshow-2016]]&gt;. Be sure to ask your developer and customer friends to join us.

 Enjoy.
BUSINESS UPDATE
a solid first quarter 
 Robert O&apos;Donovan, Chief Financial Officer
I’m pleased to report that we closed out the first quarter of 2016 strongly. We were the bright spot in EMC’s recent earnings call, growing revenues 56% year-on-year for Q1, with a market that has warmed to Pivotal Cloud Foundry &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform]]&gt; and our Big Data Suite &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/big-data/pivotal-big-data-suite]]&gt; software. We reported an impressive 200% year-on-year growth in annualized recurring revenue (ARR) on subscriptions, with a total ARR of $115 million. As noted in the past, growing annual subscription revenues helps create a more predictable business and is a key factor in achieving profitability.

Despite great year-on-year growth, our expenses were higher than expected, and we narrowly missed our ambitious ARR target in Q1. I ask that you continue to exercise discipline in how and where you spend—a key requirement to becoming a highly successful, independent company.  

Customers and Partners for the World

The world’s top companies are choosing to innovate and run their businesses on Pivotal products. This was underscored by one of the world’s largest financial institutions signing a long-term strategic collaboration with Pivotal. We also mirrored a fourth quarter win with one of world’s largest retailers when another Fortune 50 retailer chose Pivotal in Q1 as its strategic partner for digital transformation.

We inked notable technical and go-to-market partnerships &lt;[[http://www.businessinsider.com/pivotal-on-the-cloud-wars-with-amazon-microsoft-and-google-2016-4]]&gt; with cloud providers Google, Microsoft, and Cisco &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform/press-release/pivotal-teams-up-with-cisco]]&gt;, adding to our partnerships with AWS, VMware, and OpenStack. We now work with every major IaaS vendor and cloud provider. This flexibility has no parallel in the industry, and it evinces our case that Pivotal Cloud Foundry &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform]]&gt; is the world’s most powerful continuous innovation cloud platform. As we expand our footprint and customer base across the automotive, financial services, insurance, retail and telecommunications industries, we are becoming synonymous with these big-name cloud leaders.

Overall, the first quarter has put us on course for a solid mid-year report, so stay tuned!
PRODUCT UPDATE
 Pivotal and the New Global Ecosystem
 Nick Cayou, Vice President, Global Ecosystem, and Josh McKenty, Global Ecosystem Engineering
It’s been a veritable Cambrian explosion &lt;[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion]]&gt; for those of us engaged in partner and ecosystem activities for Pivotal, with surging growth and diversification across our strategic technology partners, ISVs (independent software vendors), SI’s (system integrators), and 
Federation partners within a very short timeframe. 

 This ecosystem of partners is key to helping Pivotal and its platform of continuous innovation remain at the center of the software-driven transformation across the enterprise. We formed the new Global Ecosystem Team &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/corporate-marketing/corporate-communications/news-archive/global-ecosystem]]&gt; to cultivate and expand the mutual business and technology value created through them.

 Here is summary of the biggest developments within this 
ecosystem:


 - ISV’s: Customers increasingly view our platform as central to their application, cloud, and cultural transformations. However, we can’t do this alone. ISVs help us extend our value and are key to our growth. Josh McKenty spearheaded an immensely successful ISV day &lt;[[https://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal-cloud-foundry/news/industry-day-signals-big-things-for-cloud-foundry-ecosystem]]&gt; in February that lit the fuse with our ISV ecosystem partners. We’re actively engaged in helping dozens of ISV partners integrate deeply with PCF, largely to serve the requirements of our largest customers. 
 -  Systems Integrators: Global and regional SI’s are important to Pivotal in many ways. Most importantly, they help us scale our delivery and grow our PCF footprint in accounts. They bring application development services to larger enterprises who have scaling, geographic, or other requirements that we cannot serve through Labs. The Pivotal Ready Partner program &lt;[[https://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal-cloud-foundry/news/introducing-the-pivotal-ready-partner-program]]&gt; launched in May helps us formally onboard SI partners. To date, we have over a dozen signed partners, with many engaged in client accounts. 

 -  Strategic Partners: Larger systems vendors and public cloud providers have opened up new partner opportunities for Pivotal. In December, we announced &lt;[[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160216005696/en/Pivotal-Announces-Reseller-Agreement-Cisco-Deliver-Pivotal]]&gt; how our new partner, Cisco Systems, would resell Pivotal Cloud Foundry globally. In March, we completed the initial technical integration with Google Cloud Platform, and showcased this at Google NEXT &lt;[[https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/03/how-Google-is-bringing-cloud-computing-innovation-to-the-enterprise.html]]&gt;. We’re working hand-in-hand with Google on select large accounts, and moving to broader product integration and joint marketing. In April, Pivotal and Microsoft announced the availability of PCF through the Azure Marketplace &lt;[[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partners/pivotal/pivotal-cloud-foundryazure-pcf/]]&gt;, and Pivotal was featured &lt;[[https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/KEY02]]&gt; in a 
keynote at Microsoft’s Build conference in front of 5,000+ developers. We are pursuing over 100 opportunities jointly, and we expect to rev up our go-to-market efforts with Microsoft over the next few quarters. 
 -  Federation: We have expanded important partnerships with our federation partners, EMC, VMware, and Dell. EMC continues to embrace PCF, and will have more to announce on that at EMC World, while VMware and Pivotal announced a joint PCF/Photon &lt;[[http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/pivotal-vmware-team-up-accelerate-deployment-cloud-native-applications-with-advanced-nyse-vmw-2118276.htm]]&gt; play this week. 



Collectively, these are the most significant ties and the greatest influence we’ve had in this ecosystem. We look forward to reporting back on our progress.
AGILE UPDATE
 The Principles of a Good User Story
Heddy Stern, Product Manager
Before joining Pivotal Labs &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/labs]]&gt;, I didn&apos;t know what small, incremental, feature-based user stories looked like. I was writing 15-page requirement docs or working with developer-written user stories. But, since joining Pivotal Labs &lt;[[https://medium.com/u/8165b1293ea1]]&gt;, I&apos;ve learned what a really powerful user story can look like for my team. And I&apos;d like to share it with you. 

 When I write a story for a Pivotal Labs team, I find that the most successful backlogs are filled with individual user stories that:


 - Are as small as possible; 
 - Clearly matter to the user; 
 - Are independent of other stories; and 
 - Make it clear to everyone when the feature is done. 


As an example, I decided to try this exercise with an app I&apos;m really excited about—Cambridge-based Hopper &lt;[[http://www.hopper.com/]]&gt;—an app for booking cheap flights. (Note, I&apos;ve never actually worked on this app.) 

 How this story would have come to be: Let&apos;s assume Mike (our user persona) is searching for a new one-way flight. He can already see his search results listed by price of the flight. We learned that Mike uses hopper to book vacations but has a limited number of vacation days. He wants to make sure that his flight doesn&apos;t interfere with their workday schedule and doesn&apos;t add extra vacation time to their trip. 

Based on that problem, the product and design team would have come up with the following feature and user story:

 

From top: User story in Pivotal Tracker; Visual flow based on story, in Hopper application.
A backlog filled with this type of story clearly communicates a set of priorities that teams can execute on and feel great about.
Customer Spotlight
Bloomberg and Pivotal, a Digital Attraction
Pivotal&apos;s James Watters and Bloomberg&apos;s Compute Architecture head, Justin Erenkrantz, recently discussed our unique partnership during our Worldwide Kick Off. The video of this conversation &lt;[[https://youtu.be/8Av4R6rQwBY]]&gt; highlights how Bloomberg&apos;s role as a leader in the financial markets has a lot to do with its deep and ongoing digital transformation. Engineers from Pivotal and Bloomberg are working side-by-side to improve Bloomberg&apos;s infrastructure, and leveraging the open source community.

Lookout for the Q1 customer win slides that we’re posting in the coming weeks on Inside 
Pivotal. You&apos;ll hear directly from reps on story behind deals like GE Capital, Conversant and Merrill Corp. Finally, check out the 2016 Reference Prize Catalogue &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/customer-marketing-and-programs/references/2016-prize-catalog]]&gt; for this year&apos;s incentives. All sales reps are encouraged and invited to participate in the reference program &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/customer-marketing-and-programs/references/reference-system]]&gt;. Do you have a customer who&apos;s ready to tell their story through a webcast, analyst call, case study or video?

PEOPLE UPDATE
 A Movement in CODE
 Maria Simeonova, Executive Assistant
Cornelia Davis’ presentation at Kickoff underscored an important moment for Pivotal. We’re seeing an enormous amount of interest and dialogue in diversity and inclusion, and importantly, momentum in how to move towards that (see our new Diversity &amp; Inclusion &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/departments/human-resources/diversity-inclusion]]&gt; page for some of those efforts). Many more of us are eager to—in typical Pivotal fashion—hack away at this important topic.

Pivotal is holding screenings of the movie CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap &lt;[[http://codedocumentary.com/]]&gt; in eight of our offices. You can check out the schedule here &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/departments/human-resources/diversity-inclusion/events]]&gt;. These events have become great forums for voicing concerns, sharing personal experiences, and for brainstorming the kinds of things we can do around diversity and inclusion.

I attended the first screening, which took place in our San Francisco office mid-January, organized by Pivot 
Can Berk Güder, with Abby Kearns as moderator of a panel that included Janice Fraser, Onsi Fakhouri, and Sree Trummidi.

Questions from the audience dictated the panel discussion. Topics of interest included the importance of providing young women and minorities with industry role models, ways to counter implicit bias, re-examining the screening process, and helping more women progress to positions of leadership.

As the conversation turned to address the 
recruiting pipeline, several Pivots shared their experience working with outside organizations, which aim to reach underrepresented talent and teach them the necessary skills.

Watching CODE and taking part in the conversation reminded me of why I was so excited to join Pivotal last 
spring—people here care about making this an awesome workplace. Pivots care about their work, but also about their peers and their community.

To quote the movie, “culture is made in the heart,” so whether you join one of your office&apos;s grassroots efforts, share your stories of discrimination, make your voice heard on Slack’s 
#diversity channel, or see CODE, you are helping make Pivotal a better place.

So check out the upcoming CODE events &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/departments/human-resources/diversity-inclusion/events]]&gt;, 
and join the conversation.
