Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

In this webinar, two Pivotal data scientists present how they helped a large financial services company evolve one of its customer-facing applications to meet the changing behavior and needs of users using data science and analytics. By using clustering-based &quot;sessionization&quot; of each user&apos;s activity, along with topic modeling and clustering techniques, the Pivotal team was able to discover typical usage patterns that helped the organization make improvements to its application and identify anomalous user sessions to detect misuse. 

 This session examines data science-driven product innovation. Register today for your chance to learn: 

 - The role of data science in application and product development 
 - Why understanding user behavior is important to achieving business goals 
 - How to analyze application usage data to better understand user behavior 
 - How to turn those insights into new and improved application features 
 - How to build a sustainable data-driven application development practice
