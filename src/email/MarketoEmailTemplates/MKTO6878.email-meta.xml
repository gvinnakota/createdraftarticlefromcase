Hi, this is Angus from Pivotal. My focus is building the business between Pivotal and VMware. This week we focus in on PKS and the great work the we are doing together to deliver a Kubernetes dial-tone for all the customers of Dell, VMware and Pivotal. Why a dial-tone? Because our customers need a predictable, secure, always-on way to run their containers. More and more customers are using container technology to package apps and services and are using Kubernetes as the infrastructure to run those containers. We have taken the best of Pivotal, Google, and VMware technology to make PKS the best place to run Kubernetes in production. When a developer says, &quot;Hey, run this container for me.&quot; the answer is, &quot;Great, here is the standard Kubernetes API you already know and love&quot;. PKS is taking care of all the operational requirements, security, scalability, failover, and seamless updates that are needed for real production. PKS is the perfect way for IT ops teams to run containerized workloads.

 


 



 


 

1. PKS momentum in q3
9 months after GA and PKS is winning more customers faster than we ever dreamed. At the top end of the market 30 of the Fortune 500 are PKS customers. Commercial accounts are embracing PKS at an amazing rate. Customers love the combination of PKS on vSphere with Wavefront. We have even packaged the services required to deploy PKS into a simple two week engagement that customers can buy from Pivotal or VMware. Want to make it even easier to deploy PKS? The answer is PRA &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/pivotal-ready-architecture]]&gt;; a proven architecture for running PKS on vSphere with NSX and VSAN on VxRail. PRA is the easy button for customers who want to get their workloads running fast.

The product team made some big steps in Q3. The release of PKS 1.2 gave us support for AWS. Now we can deliver on the Hybrid Cloud value prop for customers who want to run PKS on their private clouds, AWS, or GCP. Next stop will be adding Azure to the mix. Customers love the option of having the same operational model for their workloads on Kubernetes no matter where it runs. That is the Kubernetes dial-tone.


 


 



 


 


2. turning on the channel


In Q1, PKS will be available through the VMware Channel &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/blog/vmware-pks-competency-kubernetes-abstraction-going-mainstream]]&gt;. This big announcement made at VMware EMEA is two-fold:



	- VMware will launch a learning competency &lt;[[https://blogs.vmware.com/partner/2018/11/pks-competency.html]]&gt; for channel partners to sell and deploy PKS across the globe, partners can start on available content &lt;[[https://www.vmware.com/partners.html?06934000002ojWN]]&gt; today.
	- Partners that complete the learning program will be able to in Q1, register deals through the normal processes and access PKS on the Channel Price Book just like they can with any other VMware product.



Partners are key to customer success with containers. Earlier in the year we announced the PKS Partner Lighthouse Project which is a pilot to engage a small number of partners early to support PKS campaigns and projects in the following ways: proof of concept, infrastructure design to application and DevOps consulting.

Are you working on a PKS deal and need support from a partner? Let us know &lt;[[mailto:AskDellTech@pivotal.io]]&gt;.

3. vmware acquires heptio

Have you heard of Heptio? They are the gold-standard in the open source community for pure OSS deployments of Kubernetes. The founders of Heptio created Kubernetes at Google, and continue to be active in the community in making Kubernetes better and better. Having Heptio as part of VMware is a huge win for us &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/blog/were-looking-forward-to-welcoming-heptio-to-the-family-this-is-why-our-customers-will-be-the-big-winners]]&gt;.

The Heptio acquisition is all about accelerating the VMware and Pivotal PKS strategy of being the leading Enterprise Kubernetes company, delivering a consistent &quot;dial tone&quot; in all the ways that customers want Kubernetes, and it represents a great addition of talent, of community contribution, and commitment to the ecosystem.

4. More ways to consume PKS - introducing VMware Cloud PKS


Remember we said we want PKS to be the dial-tone for Kubernetes? VMware Cloud PKS is a new offering for customers who want to run their containers on Kubernetes, but want someone else to manage the service.This is PKS as SaaS. PKS lets you run on the cloud of your choice (VMware PKS) and as a service (VMware Cloud PKS). VMware Cloud PKS &lt;[[https://assets.cloud.vmware.com/v3/assets/blt58b49a8a0e43b5ff/blt73234493aaae2b5d/5b6a0246fb24522e47c62faf/vmware-vke-solution-overview.pdf]]&gt; is Beta now, with GA expected early in FY20. If the customer is not sure whether they want to manage their own PKS service, or have someone do it for them, don’t worry. Sell PKS and the customer can consume it however they want. We deliver the Kubernetes dial-tone.

 


 



 


 


5. PKS Win Wires - a preview of what is to come

So far we have published win wires for INEGI in Mexico and Telecom Italia in Italy. Win wires are a great snapshot of the deals we are doing together, showcasing the kind of success we get by, leveraging the best of Dell, VMware and Pivotal. We are working on a handful of new win wires that will be published in the coming weeks. Chow Sang Sang is a Jewelry retailer in Hong Kong who are reinventing how they engage with customer using PKS and PRA. McDonalds in China is using PKS and PRA to develop new ways to interact with their customers, making it easier to get that hamburger and fries that you are craving. Fidelity in the US is embracing PKS and PAS on PRA to build and run their applications at scale; another great win for all of us.
