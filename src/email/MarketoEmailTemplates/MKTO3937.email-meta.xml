    <textOnly>As of today, the new Pivotal Customer Portal is now available for all Pivotal Greenplum and Pivotal Hadoop software customers, including those with EMC Data Computing Appliance (DCA). 

 IMPORTANT NOTE: Both EMC and Pivotal Support teams will continue collaborating closely to ensure that EMC DCA hardware and Pivotal Greenplum and/or Pivotal Hadoop software Service Requests (SRs) are properly routed, providing customers with a seamless support experience.
