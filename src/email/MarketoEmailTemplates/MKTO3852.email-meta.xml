    <subject>Business Conduct Guidelines and Complaint Procedure</subject>
    <textOnly>Each year, as part of Pivotal&apos;s Compliance Program, I review and send out to all employees, Pivotal&apos;s Business Conduct Guidelines &lt;[[https://drive.google.com/a/pivotal.io/file/d/0BzRTGlV4YPcbMVZ3ZUtYTHZheTg/view?usp=sharing]]&gt;.

The Guidelines discuss the application of Pivotal&apos;s three core principles (do the right thing, do what works, and be kind) to the various business, ethical and legal issues that we face. Please review and follow them. The Guidelines also contain a Complaint Procedure &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/departments/legal#TOC-COMPLAINT-PROCEDURE-AND-ANONYMOUS-HOTLINE]]&gt; and a hotline that allows you, anywhere in the world, to raise ethical or legal concerns, including anonymously.

This communication is not a &quot;check-the-box&quot; exerciseâ€”if you have reasonable concerns that relate to integrity or legal compliance, we want to hear about them.

Thank you for your commitment to Pivotal&apos;s principles. If you have questions, please contact me at: generalcounsel@pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:generalcounsel@pivotal.io]]&gt;.

Regards,
