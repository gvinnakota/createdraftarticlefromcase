    <subject>SpringOne Platform – Private Call for Proposals &amp; Registration</subject>
    <textOnly>All,
2017 is off to a fantastic start: exciting new customers, clear market momentum, and another opportunity for record-breaking bookings. Thanks to this year&apos;s SpringOne Platform &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/]]&gt; in December, we’re going to have a fantastic finish as well. Today, both the conference registration and a private call for proposals are open.
My ask? Invite customers, and submit talks!
First, speak to customers TODAY about registering for SpringOne Platform. I haven&apos;t heard a single customer say they regretted attending in 2016, and we expect an even better show in 2017. If your customer cares about getting better at software, then this is the best event they could attend this year. Here is an email template &lt;[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h0qTYY-7gcc3GnjzFsDC4ETS5b4duHGT2SCGsXYuHj0/edit]]&gt; that you can use to invite customers, and be sure to check out the Inside Pivotal page &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/corporate-marketing/events/springone-platform-2017]]&gt; for all the event details.
Second, a private call for proposals &lt;[[https://2017.springoneplatform.io/eSites/s1p/profile]]&gt; is now open for Pivotal customers, partners, and Pivotal employees. This gives you an early chance to impact the program with compelling product updates and customer stories. After June 1, a public call for proposals will go live, and the broader developer and business community will be able to submit talks.
Want to attend SpringOne Platform?
Employees are welcome to attend SpringOne Platform, but must receive manager approval prior to registering. Once approved please register using this link &lt;[[https://2017.springoneplatform.io/ehome/s1p/registration/employees]]&gt; (the link is for internal use only, please do not share with anyone outside of Pivotal), and the $1025 cost will be charged to your cost center number via Pivotal finance. Please use your Pivotal email address when you register, so we can verify you are an employee. Due to limited seating, we are asking that Pivotal employees not to sign up for training until we get closer to the conference date.
Pivotal Travel
We have room blocks at the Marriott Marquis, the Intercontinental, and Park Central hotels for those traveling to the conference. Please book one of these hotels at the end of your registration form, and book your flight separately on Concur.
Questions?

 
DO NOT reply to this email. Please email platform@pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:platform@pivotal.io]]&gt; with your questions. 
I’m excited to see the talks that you and our customers submit. Let’s make SpringOne Platform 2017 one to remember!
