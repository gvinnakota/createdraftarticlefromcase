    <subject>SpringOne Platform is Next Week! A Few Important Reminders</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/?utm_source=livestream&amp;utm_medium=email link&amp;utm_campaign=springoneplatform2017]]&gt;
Dear fellow Pivot and SpringOne Platform attendee, 

 SpringOne Platform makes its way to San Francisco next week from December 4-7, and it&apos;s shaping up to be quite an event, with an expected 2,800+ customers, prospects, partners, and Pivots in attendance. 

 To make this event truly memorable for our guests, let&apos;s remember that we&apos;re all ambassadors for Pivotal. Be kind and gracious hosts, and please keep the following in mind:


	- Take advantage of the yummy conference eats! Your conference pass includes all meals served at Moscone West, so skip breakfast and lunch at the Pivotal San Francisco office. Food lines will be long, so please treat all attendees as VIPs (that is, let your non-Pivotal peers eat first).
	- We have limited seating for Main Stage sessions. If you notice the room filling up, allow non-Pivotal attendees to find their seats first.
	- Be mindful of what you say, how you say it, and to whom. There will be customers, prospective customers, and a number of news media present at any given time.
	- Give back. We are partnering with Toy for Tots Foundation &lt;[[https://www.toysfortots.org/]]&gt; to support less fortunate children during the holiday season. Support this effort by bringing an unwrapped gift to Moscone West.
	- And of course, have fun and enjoy yourself!



Thank you for your understanding and cooperation! Letâ€™s have a great SpringOne Platform!!
