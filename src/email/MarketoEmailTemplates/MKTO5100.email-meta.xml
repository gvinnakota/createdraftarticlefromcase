Parking
Pivotal has designated parking on the right side of the building, the spaces are underneath the canopies. There will be a security guard present as you approach the spots, let them know you are here for a Pivotal event and they will direct you to a spot. If all the canopy spots are full you may also park in the uncovered parking that is right past the canopy covered parking.
If you have any questions, feel free to email Patrick Gillis at pgillis@pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:pgillis@pivotal.io]]&gt;.
We look forward to seeing you,
The Pivotal Team</textOnly>
