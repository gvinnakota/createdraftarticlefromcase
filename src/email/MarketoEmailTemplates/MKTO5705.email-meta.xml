Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

After an unbelievable show in San Francisco, we’re getting ready to do it all again! Join us September 24–27, 2018 in Washington, D.C., for SpringOne Platform 2018 &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=s1p-registration-cfp-q118]]&gt;, the premier conference for people who build, deploy, and run cloud-native software. 

 This unique four-day event brings together leading software companies, enterprises, and cloud experts to collaborate, share knowledge, and create transformational software. I’m also pleased to announce three of the keynotes that we’ve lined up for the show:


	- Juergen Hoeller. The Spring Framework project lead will be back again to share all the exciting updates to the Spring family of projects.
	- Kelsey Hightower. One of Google’s developer advocates, Kelsey is an insightful speaker on topics of system design, ops, Kubernetes, serverless computing, and more.
	- Neha Narkhede. Neha is the co-founder of Confluent and one of the initial authors of Apache Kafka. She’s an expert on modern, stream-based data processing.
