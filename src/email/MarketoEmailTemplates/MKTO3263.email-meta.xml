    <subject>Real Estate Organization Changes</subject>
    <textOnly>During my recent travels to Europe and Asia, I heard a growing chorus of customers wanting to partner with Pivotal because of their confidence that we can help bring a Silicon Valley state of mind to their cities and organizations. You can see evidence of our impact when the Prime Minister of Ireland speaks at our Ireland Expansion event in Dublin, or senior leaders of Japan’s largest companies speak at our Pivotal office opening in Tokyo.

Our current momentum has given us an opportunity to expand our global reach into new cities as well as increase the size of several Pivotal locations. As we seek to make our offices an embodiment of Pivotal’s values—an ideal environment to create and collaborate—we need to evolve our current approach to real estate.

To date, Pivotal’s Real Estate team has partnered with EMC. However, to realize the vision where each Pivotal office is the best possible collaboration space, we need to do more, as well as lead the effort.

Physical space is the biggest lever to closing the next big deal or on-boarding the next class of Pivots. As a result, I have asked Richard Snee to take on the responsibility to lead our Real Estate team. Effective immediately, Lisa Davern and the entire Real Estate team will report to Richard. In addition, as it relates to Real Estate, Richard will also manage the EMC relationship.

I want to thank Richard for taking on additional responsibilities, and excited the Real Estate team now plays a central role in bringing our culture to life.</textOnly>
