New Look, Same Game




Steve Casale, Sr. Manager, Corporate Communications
I can explain the new look.

With Google, Microsoft, AWS, and other masters of software amplifying their orbital influence around a star called Cloud—and with Pivotal as a large body of influence in every sphere—it&apos;s important to keep a tab on the stars, rocket launches, and cosmic realignments. It&apos;s also getting real for Pivotal with customers in the auto, financial, health, entertainment, government, and you-name-it sectors.

So to keep that cadence regular, we&apos;ve simplified the newsletter. &quot;All Things Product&quot; is the catch-all for big product news, but also for selling and other updates related to the business of software. &quot;Labs + Culture&quot; captures all things Agile and more, from office updates to activities around diversity, etc. &quot;Interestings&quot; is new—a curation of social, video, or publication snippets of interest. The fan favorite, &quot;My Name is&quot;, remains unchanged.

I still aim to report on points in time across planet Pivotal, to connect the dots and help us feel plugged into an important cosmos. This issue we have a nice summary of PCF and a fine retro piece of work from Down Under (marking the Sydney office&apos;s first ever appearance in this newsletter). 

Finally, the next Pivotal Town Hall is Thursday, 6 Oct, 12:30 PM (PST). Be sure to watch it here &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/pivotal-town-hall]]&gt;. A big thanks goes to Bryan Floberg, Chloe Jackson, and Amanda Egan on the creative side, and to Morgan Holzer for her candor and suggestions.  

Enjoy.
PCF 1.8 – More Velocity and More Value




Jared Ruckle, Principal Product Marketing Manager, Cloud Foundry
As companies adapt to become digital businesses, most challenges invariably boil down to how well you build software. More specifically, it comes down to how rapidly you can iterate on that software, and how fast you can realize time-to-value from new code.

PCF 1.8 is a big release for Pivotal, offering several new features that help customers accelerate their time-to-value, including:


 - Support for non-HTTP/S workloads. Now, with TCP Routing &lt;[[http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-8/devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html#http-vs-tcp-routes]]&gt;, a new universe of applications can be run on PCF, including IoT apps that use MQTT, and legacy workloads. The more apps you can run on a single platform with standardized tooling, the easier it is to scale for developer and operations teams across the business.
 - Log-integrated metrics &amp; monitoring &lt;[[http://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-metrics/1-1/using.html]]&gt; help resolve production issues faster. How? Devs and ops teams have the “same set of facts” to troubleshoot issues. This helps resolve a big and knotty issue where devs and ops teams wrangled over whose data was “right”. It sets both teams up to just analyze, diagnose, and solve problems.
 - A simplified path to compliance with the IPSec Add-On. This new module now encrypts data in transit—a big boost to helping customers meet PCI audit requirements.



All of these combine to achieve more velocity in the code cycle, which helps businesses accelerate and maintain a cycle of continuous innovation essential to the digital enterprise.

Another 1.8 item to highlight for the roadmap: The BOSH cloud config &lt;[[https://bosh.io/docs/cloud-config.html]]&gt; is a slick piece of enabling technology. While customers can deploy on Google Cloud Platform &lt;[[https://twitter.com/bridgetkromhout/status/760881072565587968]]&gt; and Microsoft 
Azure, these deployments do not support Ops Manager, and require significant management by Pivotal teams. Thanks to BOSH cloud config, PCF deployments on these clouds will soon be fully automated and customer self-service.

Stay tuned for more on that front! Check out the full features of the release here:

A Retro App From Sydney





Nicola Rushton, Product Designer, Sydney
Ever had that moment in a retro where you’re stuck in a remote office, someone keeps typing over your cell in Google Sheets, and you keep losing track of the conversation when the AV cuts out?

We know the 
struggle.

So we decided to do something about it while on the beach in Sydney and got to work on a retro app. In true Pivotal Labs style, we had a working product by the end of Week 1 that we used to run our own team retro. By Week 2, we had our first client team use the app and we continued gathering user feedback from a handful of Pivots. By Week 10, we (accidentally) unveiled Postfacto &lt;[[https://postfacto.io/?utm_source=internal&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=pivotal-newsletter-sept]]&gt; to the entire company and have been overwhelmed by the amount of positive feedback. Almost 400 retros have been created within the last week!



If you haven’t tried it already, Postfacto &lt;[[https://postfacto.io/?utm_source=internal&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=pivotal-newsletter-sept]]&gt; allows you to create a retro board for your team or project. It has a built-in video conferencing, as well as three columns (happy/meh/sad) and space to create and keep track of action items. 



At the start of the retro, everyone can add items using their phones. By selecting them on screen, a facilitator can highlight retro items for all participants and start the five-minute talk timer.



Retros are an amazing way for a team to own their process and build trust, so removing barriers for teams with remote 
members to get the full benefits out of their retro is something close to our hearts. 

We’d love for you to check it out! Create a retro board to get started &lt;[[https://postfacto.io/?utm_source=internal&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=pivotal-newsletter-sept]]&gt;

If you give it a go and have any feedback, please reach out at postfacto@pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:postfacto@pivotal.io]]&gt;. We’d love to hear from you! 

– With love from the Sydney Beach Team 

Bonus Tamarama – An excellent Sydney beach

And a BIG thanks to the whole team, and to all the other Pivots in Sydney and 
beyond who have offered their expertise, advice, feedback, and support on this. Keep it coming!
