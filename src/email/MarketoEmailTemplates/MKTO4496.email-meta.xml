    <textOnly>Spring Boot 1.5 and Pivotal Cloud Foundry

Speakers: Pieter Humphrey, Madhura Bhave

Spring Boot and Pivotal Cloud Foundry users won’t want to miss Spring team’s Madhura Bhave and Pieter Humphrey as they tour through the Spring Boot 1.5 release.

Inspired in part by cool community open source work from Ordina JWorks, one of the hottest new directions that the two teams are working on is the integration of Spring Boot Actuators with Pivotal Cloud Foundry. 

Attendees will be given direct linkage to product management - this is your chance to influence future integration direction! You’ll also walk away understanding all the highlights of the Spring Boot 1.5 release, including exciting improvements in Kafka and JPA support.
