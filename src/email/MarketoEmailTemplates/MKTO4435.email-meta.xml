    <textOnly>Thank you for downloading the The Cloud Native Journey eBook authored by Michael Coté, Director of Field Engineering at Pivotal.

This eBook provides guidelines about how to work with, around, and improve legacy IT with a Cloud Native approach. Author Michael Coté aims to cut through the fear you might have about transitioning to a Cloud Native approach by sharing a low-risk approach to transforming a legacy application portfolio. 

In case you missed it, we have an on-demand Cloud Native Journey Webinar Series that you might find interesting. You can view the recordings on-demand, view the SlideShare presentations, and learn more about the journey to becoming Cloud Native here.

Also, if you&apos;re interested in getting a free, cloud native readiness assessment consultation, please email cnr_assessment@pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:cnr_assessment@pivotal.io]]&gt; with a good time to talk. The call shouldn&apos;t take longer than 30 minutes and it will help you gauge your organization&apos;s position with respect to kicking off your digital transformation strategy.
