    <subject>How to get security analytics for your cloud-native apps</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


Thank you for stopping by the Pivotal booth at Sumo Logic’s Illuminate conference. At the conference, we heard that rapidly building, running, and securing modern cloud applications requires different organizational models, practices and tools. Companies often find themselves putting a lot of effort into creating these basic building blocks to rapidly deploy, patch, secure, and manage the health of their applications.
 
The new integration between Sumo Logic and Pivotal Cloud Foundry &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/platform?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=global-event-sumologic-illuminate-sf-q317]]&gt; is already helping customers reliably go from code commit to production, in minutes, without this type of “undifferentiated heavy lifting.” And they do this without sacrificing security and compliance to speed.
 
We learn from the experiences of others, and Pivotal customers, including the world’s largest Banks, Insurers, Telcos, Retailers and many others, demonstrate every day that it’s possible to completely transform the software development process by adopting great principles and platforms.
 
We can help you make direct connections with Pivotal Platform Architects to learn more about how Sumo Logic and Pivotal are working together to transform cloud-native development, operations and tools so you can get your applications to market faster and more efficiently. Meanwhile, take advantage of our library of growing resources, including:
