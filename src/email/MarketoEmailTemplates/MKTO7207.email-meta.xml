    <subject>Pivotal and VMware Join up to Win K8s Market Share</subject>
    <textOnly>March 15, 2019

Hello, I am Rob Schmitt and I have been at Pivotal since its inception. I have lived the life of bringing Pivotal to our biggest and most strategic customers over the past 6 years and now am very excited to take on the VMW Synergy role moving forward. These are exciting times as our collective message with VMW and Pivotal continues to gain traction internally and with our target account lists. Our 2019 GTM Synergy plan is agreed to and in the books at the executive level of both companies as many of you might have heard and seen at the recent VMW kickoff event in Las Vegas. Our teams will be supporting Anuj Kumar and his VMW specialists teams to drive PKS (Essentials, Enterprise and PKS Cloud) into the VMW customer and channel partner programs. We look forward to our continued success becoming even stronger in 2019!

 


 



 


 

1. Why Pivotal is so *%$*#!* Annoying


This week’s Pivotal Pulse Podcast featured guest is Ed Hoppitt, EMEAs Director for App Transformation and Cloud Native at VMware. Ed is VMware’s version of James Corden, the Late Night Show host on air until 1:00 am who sheepishly admits that his true customers are cats (whose owners have fallen asleep on the couch). For those who missed James razzing Bill Cook while on stage at their SKO, stay tuned for that video to be released. Ed calls our customers the crazy devs, highlights the diversity in approach between VMware and Pivotal’s go-to-market and offers a methodology to enhance collaboration.

2. PIVOTAL AND VMW GTM SKU’s FOR K8’S


At VMW Kickoff last week in Vegas, 3 flavors of Kubernetes our collective customers can choose from:


	- PKS Essentials: PKS K8s OSS base + tools - for customers that insist on DIY and total flexibility”
	- PK Enterprise: PKS software for enterprises that want outcomes, on premises and on the cloud(s) of their choice. This option includes the rights for “Essentials”
	- PKS Cloud: PKS as a managed service in the public cloud.





 


 



 


 


3. VMW/Pivotal STORY OF THE WEEK


RBS is a great example of how VMW and Pivotal work together to drive great outcomes for our collective customers. The key to the RBS win was solid relationship &amp; trust between the VMW and Pivotal GTM teams locally. Both teams had a cadence of communication and drove the same consistent message to the Executives at RBS. Together, the combined VMW and Pivotal teams landed PAS, and since have expanded PAS and added PKS - with a shortened sales cycle. The original PKS deal was $250K and will follow up with another $1M in ACV this year. RBS had selected Red Hat OpenShift as its PaaS layer but the strong unified message from VMW and Pivotal helped push RBS to ultimately select both PAS and PKS. The customer quoted “ the Message of VMware and Pivotal working together is a lot stronger than that of Redhat”.
NSX-T is the next domino to fall at RBS. RBS saw the power of this product integration and was a significant part of the final selection decision. The VMware revenue drag will flow this year.

 


 



 


 


4. Kroger Feeds the Human Spirit

Check out the video from Kroger and the Pivotal/VMW team below. Kroger produced this video for Pivotal/VMW as part of the NRF back in December. This is a great video which highlights the value Pivotal/VMW (with both PKS and PAS) is bringing a large retailer that you can share with your customers and targets. These workloads run on vSphere today and the value is evident in this great video. Check it out and share the story of success with your customers! Thx to all for making this happen!

5. Customer Spotlight: Mastercard
 
Mastercard is a perfect poster child of an account done by combined teams. They continue to bet on the Pivotal PKS and PAS platforms and have standardized their deployments on PRA which will span across their global data centers. This deal grew the footprints of PAS and PKS for both net new app dev platforms and the containerization of legacy applications.
Key Facts:


	- The Mastercard VMW, Dell and Pivotal team has been challenged with overcoming complex path-to-production issues along with big company politics and has overcome these challenges with a strong commitment by just doing the right thing when it comes to product enhancements, customer proposals and a 
synchronized executive talk track.
	- Pivotal and VMW product management, executive, and engineering teams have consistently stepped up to the challenge and have worked tirelessly to understand Mastercard&apos;s requirements go above and beyond and ultimately met Mastercards PKS technical demands.
	- This is a great example of what can happen when the combined team works closely with the customer and brings the holistic PRA strategy and shows the value.
	- Mastercards initial position was to displace vSphere as well as other cloud based options from a hardware infrastructure perspective. Pivotal, Dell, and the VMW team together convinced the executive team the PRA configuration was the right one for them and now Mastercard plans to deploy the PRA in all of their regional data centers as they expand globally!
	- This is a huge win for the PKS, PRA and VMW suite of products! Great job to all!
