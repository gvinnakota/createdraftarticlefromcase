EDITOR WELCOME
 To Boldy Go...
 Steve Casale &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1033819-stephencasale&gt;, Sr. Manager, Corporate Communications
While I never made vocal claims to being a Trekkie, the recent passing of Leonard Nimoy nonetheless reminded me how much I enjoyed the original Star Trek series and the unflappable Vulcan that spawned an enduring, industrial-sized fan base. I loved the opening &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdjL8WXjlGI&gt;: “To boldly go where no man has gone before...” Cue the alien chorus!
 
 A lot has transpired the past few weeks, including Pivotal 
boldly laying out a big data strategy &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/events/pivotal-data-strategy-launch&gt; that garnered an unprecedented share of voice, and media and analyst attention &lt;http://app.trendkite.com/report?id=69b6995e-d4f5-44ac-83eb-83d508f506c7&gt; for Pivotal (270 media mentions alone), followed by an exceptional 2015 Worldwide Sales Kick-Off.
 
 Scott Aronson offers excellent nuggets 
from 2015 WWSKO. Andrew Clay Shafer emphasizes how it isn’t just great products, but framing technology trends in the right context for customers, that is the key to winning them. If you missed that Pivotal Data Science is now part of Pivotal Labs, Annika Jimenez offers a thoughtful summary on this new partnership.
 
 I discussed “data for doing good” with data scientist Noelle Sio, while our Field colleagues threw down the jam on community service 
at the WWSKO.
 
 Finally, the Pivotal Data Roadshow &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/events/pivotal-big-data-roadshow&gt; is coming to a city near you. Please invite prospects to join and learn all about agile data. We introduce a new section this issue, dedicated to customer stories – Customer Spotlight.
 
 As Spock said: “Change is the essential process of all existence.” Pivotal is working the intersection of change, helping customers understand where they are, and where they 
can boldly go!
 
 Enjoy.
BUSINESS UPDATE
 2015 Worldwide Sales Kick-Off – Key Takeaways
 Scott Aronson &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/927787-scottaronson&gt;, SVP, Field Operations
We recently wrapped our 2015 Worldwide Sales Kick-Off – where nearly 600 colleagues, along with our customers and partners, gathered in San Francisco. After two days, four general, and 24 breakout sessions, our Field and GTM teams have a clear path on how to execute together in 2015.
 
 I encourage everyone to take time to review the wealth of presentations and videos from our executive staff and session speakers on the Inside Pivotal WWSKO page &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/events/sales-kick-off-2015&gt;. The opportunity for customers to embrace our strategy around cloud, agile and data (as part of a common thread to drive customer transformation) has never been better. And while there were many, here are my key takeaways.
 
 The Play’s the Thing
 We have a lot of work ahead of us, and we’ve developed repeatable sales plays for 2015 to focus our execution.

For Big Data


 - Modernize the Data Infrastructure
 - Leverage Advanced Analytics
 - Deploy Data-Driven Apps at Scale



For Cloud Platform


 - Bring New Capabilities to the Enterprise – Rapid application development and continuous delivery (go-live)
 - Modernize Infrastructure Middleware – Increase agility, lower cost and complexity
 - Drive Productivity (DevOps) – Improve productivity, consistency and quality



Align and Focus
 The big things we need to focus on in the field and across the company:


 - Align for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Hyper Growth – We’ll continue to commit resources here to continue our growth trajectory.
 - Year of the Platform – Pivotal Labs will extend the customer transformation they start with agile, by helping make Pivotal Cloud Foundry the customers’ platform choice.
 - Maintain and Transform Data Business – We’ll maintain customer adoption of our big data products, while making the switch to open source.
 - Finish the Rotation to Subscription – We started this in 2014, and we’ll complete it in 2015.



The Three “P’s”
 We need to proactively measure and manage our business around the “3 P&apos;s”: Productivity, Platform (attach) and Pipeline. I drill down into each of these in my opening remarks &lt;https://drive.google.com/a/pivotal.io/file/d/0B1rVqn9ifV69VEdZakV5azc3Rjg/view&gt;.
 
 Be Bold
 Our rallying cry for 2015 is “Be 
Bold”. This is not about being cocky, but confident. Learn and get comfortable with our plays. This builds confidence and signals to customers that we’re engaged and the right partner to help them transform their business.
 
 Giving Back
 As Paul Maritz noted, we should always endeavor to give more than we take. I’m very proud we made this Pivotal value part of WWSKO. I want to thank our volunteers who took time to build a brand new computer lab at The San Francisco City Academy that will give kids in the Tenderloin district – 85% of whom live below the poverty line – a door of opportunity through technology. In addition, our Bay Area offices will continue to support the work that we started there. Find out all about it here &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/events/sales-kick-off-2015/san-francisco-city-academy&gt;.
 
 We didn’t stop there. Pivotal also donated 446 meals to the San Francisco’s homeless over the course of the week.
 
 
 Clockwise from top left: Scott 
Aronson on stage; Pivotal Award Winners. At the City Academy: New computers for Tenderloin students; Some of the Pivotal WWSKO community service team.
 
 Finally, it took a group effort of many teams, and months of preparation to pull this event off. On behalf of the entire Field, I want to once again express my deepest gratitude to our expert speakers, our executive team, and our leaders and colleagues who supported WWSKO 2015. We could never have done this without you!
 
 Good luck to everyone in Q1, and BE BOLD!
PRODUCT UPDATE
 It’s Not the Product: Context is King in Customer Discussions
 Andrew Clay Shafer &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1056492-andrewshafer&gt;, Sr. Director, Technical Marketing (Pivotal Cloud Foundry)
At the 2015 WWSKO, I emphasized that we have an opportunity to change the world with a category-defining product, and a unique ecosystem of supporting services.
 
 The first year bookings for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) validate that the industry has a desire and need for a solution, 
and that Pivotal has the leadership to deliver it. In his excellent presentation on Pivotal Cloud Foundry &lt;https://drive.google.com/a/pivotal.io/file/d/0B1rVqn9ifV69Mlcyb09rUmhOS2s/view&gt;, James Watters underscored the patterns and topics that help us close transactions in 
a noisy, nascent market. In the customer panel discussion with Bill Cook &lt;https://drive.google.com/a/pivotal.io/file/d/0B1rVqn9ifV69ZDVKNV81YVNqNk0/view&gt;, industry titans implored Pivotal to help them transform how they deliver software, while 
they also advised that we could do better at understanding domains and context.
 
 Framing Technology For Customers
 Mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) initiatives that are budgeted now will challenge the way enterprise IT handles 
everything. Moderately successful build-outs will drive the pace and scale beyond what most organizations are accustomed to delivering. DevOps, Continuous Delivery, and Microservices won’t just be optional buzzwords that excite in-the-know early adopters, they will become the de facto best practices to survive and compete in a software-defined world.
 
 In a new market, almost every opportunity hinges on 
connecting the dots from the problems customers may not know they have, to a solution they can’t conceive themselves. Our challenge is not just communicating product features, but articulating problems customers face in a language they comprehend around their business issues. That requires us to educate ourselves – not just on products, but also on the challenges and opportunities that delivering these products pose for our customers.
 
 The PCF Technical Marketing team has invested resources in developing supporting material and pivotal.io microsites 
to provide the vocabulary for conversations around DevOps, Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery, and microservices. This will include framing Pivotal products for specific industry verticals. Material around DevOps, PaaS and the Financial Services vertical is being developed now, which we expect to go live in the next few weeks. Please let us know how these impact your customer interactions, and send along any recommendations or ideas. Stay current on our PCF products page &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal-cf/&gt;, and you can reach me at ashafer@pivotal.io &lt;mailto:ashafer@pivotal.io&gt;.
AGILE UPDATE
 Pivotal Labs and its New Data Heartbeat 
 Annika Jimenez &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/919397-annikajimenez&gt;, VP Pivotal Data Science
A lot happened the past few weeks, so you might have missed the announcement that Pivotal Data Science has merged with Pivotal Labs. Given the strong synergies between data science and application development, this is a natural next step for both organizations.
 
 Pivotal Data Science has had its own technology-centric philosophy around agile, canonized in this white paper &lt;http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/papers/madskills-032009.pdf&gt;. Our team established a leadership position in data science &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/customer-marketing-and-programs/assets/data-science-story&gt; because we’re hiring the very best data scientists, and 
empowering them with Pivotal’s distributed platform (Greenplum or Hadoop/HAWQ) and open data science tool kits (including MADLib &lt;http://www.madlib.net&gt;, MLLib &lt;https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.1.0/mllib-guide.html&gt;, scikit-learn &lt;http://scikit-learn.org/&gt; and R &lt;http://www.r-project.org/&gt;) that provide the analytical agility not achievable off-stack.
 
 We’ll now bring Pivotal Labs’ agile approach into our methodologies, helping us provide insights for customers even faster. We’re currently assessing how to tweak our delivery processes to capitalize on Pivotal Labs’ core processes. This includes testing pair modeling, exploring the role of Pivotal Tracker &lt;http://www.pivotaltracker.com/why-tracker&gt; in our processes, and plugging into Pivotal Labs for operational efficiencies.
 
 But in the 
new world order, insights alone are no longer the end goal. What about analytic apps, you ask?
 
 This is Pivotal’s Holy Grail, and why it makes sense for Data Science to be a part of Pivotal Labs. A predictive model needs an application front-end (or face) for customers to realize its full potential and value. We already see a strong interest from prospects for this (CoreLogic, Honeywell, etc.). How we drive the right integration points between a data science process that is fairly linear and assumes some degree of open-ended data exploration, and Pivotal Labs’ needs-focused iterative software development process, is perhaps the most important question.
 
 Our answer to 
this will make Pivotal Labs (with its new data heartbeat) a force to be reckoned with when it comes to powering enterprise transformation. We already have early lessons from 2014 Pivotal Labs and Data Science collaborations, which can be seen here: Connected 
Car, Social &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/global-data-science/home/resources/topic-and-sentiment-analysis-demo&gt; and Transport London &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/global-data-science/home/resources/london-transport-demo&gt;.
 
 Driving app- and data-centric enterprise transformations have been the charters of Pivotal Labs and Pivotal Data Science, respectively. Bringing these two groups together catalyzes a powerful integrated change capacity that is core to Pivotal’s vision. We’re diving in now to make it happen, so stay tuned.
Customer Spotlight
We&apos;re excited to shine a light on the customer content that provides insights on the transformation Pivotal is helping customers achieve. In this issue, we spotlight:


 - Pivotal Strategy Update: Catch Corelogic, Union Bank, and CS Stars sharing their opinions on Pivotal&apos;s data strategy &lt;http://pivotal.io/new-approach-to-big-data&gt;. On February 17th, Pivotal laid out our data business strategy, and key customers offered thoughts on how this impacts them.  
 - Q4 Customer Write-ups now Available: With Rep Interview Recordings! &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/customer-marketing-and-programs/&gt; Q4 marks a year&apos;s worth of business case and win write-ups. We now have over 50 write-ups in this repository and, starting this quarter, we’re providing the interviews with reps themselves in .MP4 format (for easy download and use on the road).  
 - Check out the new Customer Page on Pivotal.io &lt;http://pivotal.io/customers&gt;. As part of the Pivotal website refresh in February, we have a slick, new customer section that can be accessed from the homepage. It’s easy to use, and customers are searchable by industry, products and services, and topic.  
 - Watch CoreLogic, JPMC, Allstate, Samsung Mobile and MasterCard discuss working with Pivotal &lt;https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/events/sales-kick-off-2015&gt;. It&apos;s a testament to our strategy that customers are willing to make time and share their perspectives at our annual Worldwide Sales Kick-Off.

PEOPLE UPDATE
 Data Science for Doing Good — Crisis Text Line
 Noelle Sio &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/923574-noellesio&gt;, Principal Data Scientist
A teenager who sends five repeat text messages to a crisis texting hotline signals to counselors that he/she is at risk. The word “hurt” shows a strong correlation with self-inflicted harm, while other word choices also suggest at-risk tendencies for youths.
 
These are the kinds of things that Principal Data Scientist, Noelle Sio, helped youth counselors from Crisis Text Line &lt;http://www.crisistextline.org/&gt; unearth from their data, and which I (your editor) had the pleasure of finding out in a recent discussion we had &lt;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8GCVlqTdMB-NFZrN1Y5Y1RmOWc&amp;authuser=0&gt; on her work in the community.
 
 Through the Pivotal Data Science community initiative, Pivotal for Good, Noelle brought her data know-how to a three-month, 
pro bono assignment with Crisis Text Line, a texting hotline that connects troubled teens to trained specialists who assist hundreds of at-risk teens every day.
 
 While the non-profit organization is data-driven, they were either short on time or resources to put together predictive 
models that sliced data many ways and yielded fast insights. Good data gives counselors insights on behaviors and helps them make better decisions. With Noelle’s help, Crisis Text Line has new ways to interpret more data - to make for a better human connection, and the results were both interesting and immediate. L &lt;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8GCVlqTdMB-NFZrN1Y5Y1RmOWc&amp;authuser=0&gt;isten to our discussion &lt;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8GCVlqTdMB-NFZrN1Y5Y1RmOWc&amp;authuser=0&gt; to learn more.
