<p>All,</p> 
<p dir="ltr">We'd like to introduce <a href="https://sites.google.com/pivotal.io/insidepivotal" target="_blank" style="color: #059a91; text-decoration: none;">Inside Pivotal 2.0</a>, a new site and starting point for important company updates, policy, and features. Based on the latest version of Google sites, we worked with Pivots to evolve the content, functionality, and purpose of Inside Pivotal.</p> 
<p dir="ltr">That evolution is based on three years of user data, a broad survey, and user interviews. We found that Pivots were frustrated by key topics and links being squirreled away on function pages, so we surfaced important and popular items, and curated content around broad interests and office locations. In addition, nearly 100 percent of Pivots access information on their mobile devices, and a large number of you were interested in a mobile-friendly version of Inside Pivotal.</p> 
<p dir="ltr">Overall, we've continuously adapted Inside Pivotal to be a source of relevant news, features, and 'interestings' for a broad audience of Pivots.</p> 
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What's new on Inside Pivotal 2.0</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Inside Pivotal 2.0 is now mobile-friendly.<br></li> 
<li>Google Sites' search indexing functionality is famously poor, so we made key information and features more discoverable on our homepage, and other landing pages.</li> 
<li><em>Monday Reset</em>: A weekly snapshot on the homepage (emojis included) that features key company news or policy updates, wins, features by Pivots, and culture stories. Early next year, we'll email this digest out each Monday (Pacific Time).</li> 
<li><em>Life at Pivotal</em>: A new section that features office life and Pivotal culture—with office and people profiles, videos, articles, policies, a new onboarding page, and a products and services overview.</li> 
<li>A footer with icons that link to Workday, gmail, instagram, Pivotalk, Slack, and more.</li> 
</ul> 
<p dir="ltr"><strong>MVP, the old site, and what's next.</strong></p> 
<p dir="ltr">Inside Pivotal 2.0 is an MVP. You'll notice that not all department pages have moved over (some have always existed independently), and they remain on the old "classic" sites. In this first iteration, we prioritized the migration of high-traffic sites such as Global Field, People/HR, Finance and T&amp;E, Marketing, and added new sites—like Services—that were already under construction.</p> 
<p dir="ltr">To make it easier to move between Inside Pivotal 2.0 and old/classic site pages, you can find any department link for pages on either the new or old/classic sites by clicking on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/pivotal.io/insidepivotal/departments" target="_blank" class="mktNoTok" style="color: #059a91; text-decoration: none;">Departments&nbsp;</a>tab&nbsp;at the top of Inside Pivotal 2.0. We've added redirects and scrubbed links on the old site, where needed. If you find links that need to redirect or are broken, just let us know.</p> 
<p dir="ltr">Take Inside Pivotal 2.0 for spin, and find out more about it in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/pivotal.io/insidepivotal/website-guide/inside-pivotal-faq" target="_blank" style="color: #059a91; text-decoration: none;">FAQ</a>&nbsp;on the Website Guide pages. And if you have cool stories or videos on people, teams, offices, and products—or questions, just let us know at: <a href="mailto:inside-pivotal@pivotal.io" target="_blank" style="color: #059a91; text-decoration: none;">inside-pivotal@pivotal.io</a>.</p> 
<p dir="ltr">Enjoy.</p>
