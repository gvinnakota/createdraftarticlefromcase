Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 

Domain Driven Design &amp; Reactive Programming On-Demand Webinar Now Available 

 If you missed our recent webinar on Domain Driven Design 
(DDD) and Reactive Programming, then we have some good news - you can now access the recording here &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/agile/webinar/domain-driven-design-and-reactive-programming]]&gt;. 

 In the webinar, author and 
thought leader Vaughn Vernon, widely regarded as the leading expert on DDD and Reactive Programming, and Wes Williams, an Advisory Data Engineer at Pivotal answered five key questions: 


 - What causes software projects to lack well-designed domains? 
 - What is a good domain model and how does it help with reducing complexity? 
 - What is the Reactive model and how does it help developers solve complex application and integration problems? 
 - How can you use these techniques to reduce time-to-market as you build software that is more flexible, scalable, and tightly aligned to business goals? 
 - How can in-memory data grids like open source Apache Geode and GemFire (Pivotal’s product based on Apache Geode) fit with these modern concepts?



A poorly designed enterprise software application can result in exorbitant costs and overall project failure. Traditional approaches have had difficulty with promoting good design practices, resulting in applications that don’t meet the needs of the business, and are costly and difficult to change. Ultimately, this severely limits the value of these applications. 

 DDD and Reactive Programming go a long way toward mitigating the complexities and risks associated with enterprise software development. 

 We hope you 
enjoy the webinar replay &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/agile/webinar/domain-driven-design-and-reactive-programming]]&gt;.
