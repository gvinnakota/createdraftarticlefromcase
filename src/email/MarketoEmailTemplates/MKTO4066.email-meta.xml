    <subject>Webinar: How important is Platform and Cloud Portability?</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/platform-and-cloud-portability]]&gt;
Join your host &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/platform-and-cloud-portability]]&gt; Michael Cot√© of Pivotal in a conversation with Holger Mueller of Constellation Research and Brian Gregory of Express Scripts International about why multi-cloud capabilities are an important differentiator when choosing an application framework.
 
Regardless of whether an organization ever moves its workloads from on-premise to a public cloud or from one IaaS to another, multi-cloud portability has become a requisite expectation that gives customers the confidence to choose the architectural paradigm best aligned with where they are in their digital transformation journey.
