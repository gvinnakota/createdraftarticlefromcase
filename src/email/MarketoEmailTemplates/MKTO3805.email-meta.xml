    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}}, 

 What an amazing time we had at Apache Geode Summit &lt;[[http://geodesummit.com/]]&gt; in March! 

 We’ve been enjoying reliving the memories with pictures and videos posted by attendees &lt;[[https://storify.com/gregchase/geodesummit-a-twitter-proceedings]]&gt;. 

 Many of you have asked where you could find the slides or replays from the sessions. We have posted these on the Apache Geode Summit schedule &lt;[[https://2016.event.geodesummit.com/schedule]]&gt;. If you were attending the sessions in the main stage, you may also be interested in viewing the future feature discussions &lt;[[https://2016.event.geodesummit.com/schedule]]&gt; between the contributors. 

 We also invite you to enjoy our blog of Key Takeaways from Apache Geode Summit &lt;[[https://blog.pivotal.io/?p=36055]]&gt;.
