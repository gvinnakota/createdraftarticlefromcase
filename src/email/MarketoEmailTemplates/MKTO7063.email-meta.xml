    <subject>5 Measurements of successful App Transformation</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},


If 
you’ve invested in your organization’s Application Transformation, how do you demonstrate progress and measure success?


Quantitative measurement is critical and we recommend defining-and continuously refining-KPIs for each step that covers the process, time, and cost improvements. However, there are signals that show your app transformation effort is succeeding.


-Increased 
software releases: Quarter over quarter improvements
-Implemented release management efficiencies: Lower lead and process time, fewer steps and handoffs
-Improved operational metrics for transitioned apps: MTTR, MTBD, support tickets, etc.
-Enhanced security: Faster patching, zero downtime upgrades, etc.
-Reduced infrastructure usage: Higher density compute, auto-scaling and 
licensing reductions
