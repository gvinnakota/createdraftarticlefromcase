    <subject>3/15/18 Webinar: Cloud-Native Data: What data questions to ask when building cloud-native apps</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar, Cloud-Native Data: What data questions to ask when building cloud-native apps &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/mar-15-cloud-native-data-what-data-questions-to-ask-when-building-cloud-native-apps-webinar?utm_source=digest&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=redislabs-q118]]&gt;, on March 15, 
2018. 

While a number of patterns and architectural guidelines exist for cloud-native applications, a discussion about data often leads to more questions than answers. For example, what are some of the typical data problems encountered, why are they different, and how can they be overcome? 

Join Prasad Radhakrishnan from Pivotal and Dave Nielsen from Redis Labs as they discuss:


	- Expectations and requirements of cloud-native data
	- Common faux pas and strategies for how you can avoid them


Presenters: 
Prasad Radhakrishnan, Platform Architecture for Data at Pivotal
Dave Nielsen, 
Head of Ecosystem Programs at Redis Labs 

Date: Thursday, March 15, 2018
Time: 11:00am PDT / 2:00pm EDT
