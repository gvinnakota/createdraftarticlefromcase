Dear {{lead.First Name:default=}},
 
We want to tell you about an interesting Meetup event happening at the Pivotal office in Palo Alto on June 21st starting at 6PM: The Analytics &amp; Data Science Behind Connected Transportation &lt;[[http://www.meetup.com/Data-Engineers-Guild/events/231421622/?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=palo-alto-meetup-q216]]&gt;. This event is being held by the Data Engineers Guild Meetup Group, &lt;[[http://www.meetup.com/Data-Engineers-Guild/]]&gt; and is sponsored by Pivotal and Uber.

Transportation is undergoing as big a revolution as when the automobile was invented. Thanks to the convergence of constantly connected devices, advanced analytics, and artificial intelligence, this change incorporates some of the latest technologies and data science methods. This area is a huge opportunity with more than 600 companies and $17B in funding &lt;[[http://insights.venturescanner.com/2015/03/20/connected-car-market-update/]]&gt;.

In this event, the Data Engineer’s 
Guild takes a look into the analytics technologies and data science techniques used in a couple of connected transportation applications.
