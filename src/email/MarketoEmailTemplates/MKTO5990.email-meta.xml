    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar Crossing the Value Stream: Improving Development with Pivotal Cloud 
Foundry &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/may-23-crossing-the-value-stream-improving-development-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-webinar?utm_source=digest&amp;utm_medium=webinars&amp;utm_campaign=value-stream-ruckle-gunter&amp;utm_term=q218]]&gt;, on May 23, 2018. 

Adopters of Pivotal Cloud Foundry have achieved remarkable gains in developer productivity. Allstate, Citi, CoreLogic, Liberty Mutual, and many others have shared their stories, detailing how they’ve attained a 3x to 4x increase in developer productivity. It’s common to hear Pivotal Cloud Foundry users share anecdotes like, “We delivered 3x the number of features this year compared to last year,” and “Our developers went from working on code only 20% of the time to 80–90% of the time.” 

Where does this productivity come from? Attend this webinar and learn the five practices that lead to these 
software development process improvements: 


	- 
Developer Self-Service

	- 
Smaller Projects and Smaller Releases

	- 
Cross-Functional, Self-Directed Teams

	- 
Increasing Visibility of Defects

	- 
Reduce Variability



Along the way, we’ll also show how Pivotal Cloud Foundry enables each practice.
