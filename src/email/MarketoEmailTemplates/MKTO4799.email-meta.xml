Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 
 We invite you to join fellow developers from the Chicago area for a two-day community event where we will share presentations and participate in open discussions about all things Spring. 
 
We’re rapidly advancing the Spring framework--adding flexibility to the programming model for cloud-native, reactive, and functional workloads. And we want you to be a part of it all! Don’t miss this opportunity to learn from and share with members of the Spring community.
