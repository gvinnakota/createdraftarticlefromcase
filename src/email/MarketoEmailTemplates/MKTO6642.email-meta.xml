    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=}},
 

Please join us for the webinar Adding Edge Data to Your AI and Analytics Strategy &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/oct-31-adding-edge-data-to-your-ai-and-analytics-strategy-webinar?utm_source=promo&amp;utm_medium=webinar&amp;utm_campaign=edgedata-hiredbrains&amp;utm_term=q418]]&gt;, on October 31, 2018. 

IoT and edge analytics/intelligence are broad terms that cover a wide range of applications and architectures. The one constant is that the data that streams in from sensors and other edge devices is valuable, offering a wealth of opportunities to process and exploit, in order to improve the products and services that enterprises offer to their customers. 

But what is the nature of these intelligent analytical operations that one could do with sensor data, and where should those operations be performed? For example, where geographically should machine-learning models be trained: near the edge, in the data center, or perhaps at an intermediate point in between? 

In this webinar, Neil Raden from Hired Brains Research and 
Frank McQuillan from Pivotal will discuss the notion of edge analytics/intelligence, including where to perform computations, what context is needed to do so effectively, and what the platforms look like that enable advanced analytics and machine learning on IoT data at scale. We will also offer examples from recent experience that demonstrate the range of possibilities.

Presenters: 
Neil Raden, Hired Brains 
Frank McQuillan, Pivotal

Date: Wednesday, October 31, 2018
Time: 10:00am PDT / 1:00pm EDT
