  and we&rsquo;re rapidly  expanding our presence and customer portfolio here.<br /><br />Since January, the APJ country leaders have been temporarily reporting to me.
     The arrival of Lionel gives this remarkable team a proven leader with extensive customer relationships, and a deep understanding of the region.

     Pivotal&rsquo;s customer focus, its collaborative and empowered teams, and the transformational effect it has on customers come from a unique set of values and principles.
