    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

I&apos;m sorry you weren&apos;t able join us on Tuesday for our webinar. Cot√© profiled the third most common journey that our Pivotal Cloud Foundry customers undertake: organization transformation. We looked at what an IT department that has transformed into a Cloud Native enterprise looks like and how it got there. We covered:


 - The fundamental importance of culture and change
 - How and what IT is doing to support the business
 - How to program the meatware to effectively run inside a Cloud Native organization



Please check out the replay &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/ensuring-cloud-native-success-organization-transformation]]&gt; and slides &lt;[[http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/lFb81VFv2i1hy5]]&gt; and think about whether your organization is on the right track to transformation. I would love the opportunity to have a deeper conversation about how Pivotal can help you in your journey to become Cloud Native. Call or email me and we&apos;ll schedule time to discuss.

Thanks and I look forward to talking with you,
