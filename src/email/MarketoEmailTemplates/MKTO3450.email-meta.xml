    <subject>Dell EMC Integration Update</subject>
    <textOnly>As Joe Tucci&apos;s note below explains, the Dell/EMC transaction to combine the two organizations is on schedule under the original timetable and the original terms.
 
 Today, Michael Dell met with his extended leadership team at Dell, where he announced the executive leadership team for the combined Dell/EMC company.
 
 For Pivotal, it’s important to remember Michael Dell’s video message from our Worldwide Kick–Off:

“As you embark on a new year, know that Pivotal is operating from a position of strength—with the right subscription based business model, the right cloud platform and analytics, and the right software development services. The post-close strategy remains the same as the strategy today, Pivotal will remain an independent company and it rests on all your shoulders to get Pivotal into hyper growth mode, and we’re going to help extend your reach and access to new customers.”

 Message from Joe Tucci
 
 CONFIDENTIAL – FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY
 
 I want to give you an important update on our pending merger with Dell. Our integration planning teams are making significant progress across all workstreams. We are starting to make some decisions on what the future combined business will look like, and it is exciting to see the new company start to come together.
 
 Today, Michael Dell is meeting with his extended leadership team at Dell, where he is announcing the planned executive leadership team for the combined Dell/EMC company. These leadership appointments will become effective immediately after the close of the transaction, which we expect will occur later this year. Until the transaction closes, we must continue to operate EMC and Dell as separate entities.
 
 The merger is on schedule under the original timetable and terms. We recently received antitrust clearance from regulatory agencies in the United States, European Union and several other countries around the world. We are also working to finalize the proxy statement and set the date for a Special Meeting of EMC shareholders later in the spring.
 
 The combined business will be incredibly well-positioned for growth in the most strategic areas of next generation IT including digital transformation, software-defined data center, converged infrastructure, cloud, mobile and security. We have a solid foundation to build upon that features two of the world’s greatest technology companies with leadership positions in Servers, Storage, Virtualization and PCs.
 
 The combination of Dell and EMC, along with three strategically-aligned 
businesses—Pivotal, SecureWorks and VMware—will be a technology powerhouse that will deliver world-class products and solutions to customers and partners. This complementary and aligned family of businesses will drive innovation, customer choice and the ability to attract and retain world-class talent.
 
 The new company will have the most experienced, knowledgeable and capable leadership team in our industry, bar none. Upon close of the transaction, Michael’s planned team to lead the new company will be (in alphabetical order by last name):

 - Jeremy Burton, Chief Marketing Officer, responsible for brand, events, marketing analytics, digital and communications
 - Jeff Clarke, Vice Chairman and President, Operations and Client Solutions, responsible for Global Supply Chain and End User Computing organizations
 - Howard Elias and Rory Read, co-Chief Integration Officers, for the Dell|EMC integration
 - David Goulden President, Enterprise Systems Group, responsible for the global infrastructure organization including servers, storage, networking, converged infrastructure and solutions. Bill Scannell, President, Enterprise Sales, will report to David and lead the global go-to-market organization serving our Enterprise customers.

The enterprise business that David will lead will be larger than EMC is today and will leverage top talent we have across EMC. Also part of Enterprise Systems Group are: Rodney Rogers, CEO, Virtustream, Amit Yoran, President, RSA, and Rohit Ghai, President, Enterprise Content Division. Other members of David’s leadership team will be announced at a later date.

 - Marius Haas, President &amp; Chief Commercial Officer, responsible for global go-to-market organization serving Commercial customers
 - Steve Price, Chief Human Resources Officer
 - Karen Quintos, Chief Customer Officer, responsible for leading revenue and margin enhancing programs, ensuring a consistent customer experience across multiple channels and driving strategies to strengthen and build profitable customer relationships. Karen will also lead Corporate Citizenship, including social responsibility, entrepreneurship and diversity.
 - Rich Rothberg, General Counsel
 - John Swainson, President, Dell Software, will continue in his current capacity
 - Tom Sweet, Chief Financial Officer
 - Suresh Vaswani, President, Dell Services, will continue in his current capacity

Bill Scannell, Marius Haas and Jeff Clarke will lead the new company’s three global go-to-market organizations: Enterprise, Commercial and Consumer &amp; Small Business. They will be working together over the next few months to determine which accounts and people align to each go-to-market organization. This segmentation approach preserves the best of the EMC and Dell sales motions and will drive clear accountability for results, enable more decision-making closer to customers, and allow faster feedback between customers, sales and product teams.
 
 Michael will also establish an executive group, which will include the presidents of business units and go-to-market organizations, plus: Pat Gelsinger, CEO, VMware; Rob Mee, CEO, Pivotal; Rodney Rogers; and Mike Cote, President and CEO, SecureWorks. This group will collaborate on innovative and differentiated solutions, optimize operations to increase the speed and agility with which we serve our customers and find ways to work together more efficiently and effectively as an organization.
 
 Again, this new organizational structure will become effective immediately following the completion of the transaction. Until then, all reporting structures remain as they are. There are still critical decisions to be made about a number of important pieces of the combined company, and some of that work is still ongoing. This announcement is not inclusive of all functions, so you can anticipate further updates as soon as practical as decisions are made.
 
 The coming together of Dell and EMC is a game-changer, creating a powerhouse in the technology industry with approximately $80 billion in revenue. Dell and EMC have demonstrated abilities to win in fast-changing markets. We expect the combined business to possess unmatched scale, strength and flexibility to help customers achieve their goals, supported by deep investments in R&amp;D and innovation and a privately controlled ownership structure.
 
 On the VMware side, Michael and I are both incredibly excited by the prospects for this great company, and I firmly believe that Michael will be an outstanding steward of this company. Once the transaction closes, I know Michael will be laser-focused on increasing the value of VMware for all stakeholders and will ensure that VMware has the right resources and people to fully realize its potential.
 
 In addition, Pivotal continues its strong customer momentum and growth, disrupting traditional middleware players as it emerges as a leader in the modern cloud era. We also expect very high growth ahead for Virtustream, and Michael and I are very excited about the prospects for our Virtustream business.
 
 I am extremely proud of the more than 70,000 talented and dedicated people across the EMC family of companies. I know that you will remain laser focused on our customers and their needs during this transition. My deepest thanks to all of you.
 
 Joe
