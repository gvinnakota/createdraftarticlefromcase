Join us &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/ensuring-cloud-native-success-organization-transformation]]&gt; tomorrow, April 7th for the last installment in our Ensuring Cloud Native Success series: Organization Transformation. To get the full benefit of a cloud native approach, you&apos;ll likely need to change how your organization functions and behaves: you&apos;ll have to change its culture.
 
 When software is thought of as a series of ongoing products instead of discrete projects, the way the IT department is managed and run changes accordingly. Part 3 will cover the motivations for those changes and outlines how to start transforming everyday management, strategy, staffing, and operations to become a cloud native enterprise. Register now &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/ensuring-cloud-native-success-organization-transformation]]&gt; to join Cot√© and team as they profile the third most common journey that our Pivotal Cloud Foundry customers 
undertake.
 
 See you soon,
 The Pivotal Team
