    <subject>7/12 Webinar - Spring on Google Cloud Platform</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar Spring on Google Cloud Platform, &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/jul-12-spring-on-google-cloud-platform-webinar?utm_source=digest&amp;utm_medium=webinars&amp;utm_campaign=spring on google cloud&amp;utm_term=q318]]&gt; on July 12, 2018. 

Pivotal and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) collaborate on a number of projects—including Pivotal Cloud Foundry Service Broker for GCP and Spring Boot starters—that make it easy 
to leverage GCP&apos;s managed services, whether you are starting a new project or migrating an existing on-premise project. 

In this talk, we&apos;ll examine different GCP-created tools that help you develop and run Java and Spring applications, such as Spring Cloud GCP. In addition, we&apos;ll look at the different runtime environments that you can deploy to, such as Google Kubernetes Engine, App Engine, and Pivotal Cloud Foundry with GCP Service Broker. 

Finally, we&apos;ll go over some of the platform services that help you monitor, troubleshoot, profile, and debug your Java production application.
