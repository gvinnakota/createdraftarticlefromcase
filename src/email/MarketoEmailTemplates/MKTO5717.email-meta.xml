Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 
You&apos;re invited to attend Greenplum Summit &lt;[[http://greenplumsummit.io/]]&gt;, an event dedicated to Greenplum Database, at PostgresConf &lt;[[https://postgresconf.org/conferences/2018]]&gt;. It’s all happening April 16-20 in Jersey City, and we want you to be part of it! We have tons of great sessions planned - including a conference keynote by Greenplum original co-founder Scott Yara, presentations by Greenplum customers GE Digital, Morgan Stanley, and Conversant, and pre-conference training.
At Greenplum Summit you’ll examine customer case studies, develop new skills through in-depth tutorials, share emerging best practices in Postgres-based data analytics, and envision the future of data technology while networking with your peers.
