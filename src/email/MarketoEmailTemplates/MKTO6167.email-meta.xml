    <textOnly>June 29, 2018

Happy Friday! The Pivotal Pulse 5-Point Friday is a quick weekly update from your brothers and sisters that lives at the intersection of Pivotal, VMware, and Dell EMC.

 


 



 


 


1. PKS 1.1 is Generally Available!
 
On the product front - the big news is this PKS 1.1 release &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/blog/pivotal-container-service-1-1-now-ga-helps-you-run-kubernetes-without-complexity-why-pks-just-works]]&gt;. PKS demand has been off the charts, and customers, analysts and yes, we ourselves are starting to realize some BIG IDEAS: 

1) PCF is a multi-abstraction, multi-cloud platform that can run all workloads - so PAS, PKS and PFS are not an “OR” discussion, but an “AND” discussion
2) Pivotal and VMware are determined to have the best enterprise Kubernetes in 
the world. 

PKS 1.1 represents the second wave of our PKS efforts - now ready for production with multi-master, multi-AZ, improved security/authentication and the beginnings of a lot more to come on platform observability. We believe that for customers who want SUSTAINED speed - a platform as product approach to Kubernetes - and build around the enterprise realities that they will have many K8s clusters - not a single mega cluster… this PKS design center is proving right in the market.


 


 



 


 


2. What do Fidelity, Citibank, Swisscom, T-Mobile, and RBS all have in common?


All are early PKS customers, all are customers who have bet big and won big on PAS, and all of them are cases where Pivotal is partnered deeply with VMware and Dell EMC… oh and all of them are customers I’ve spent time with this past week. To me, they are also representative of what’s happening around the globe. Pivotal is the tip of the Digital Transformation dialog with customers - but we win BIG as a broader Dell Technologies team.


 


 



 


 


3. Customer Highlight - Ford

4. 4X Your Sales with Pivotal
 
Dell EMC Brothers and Sisters have proven this point over and over. When selling with Pivotal, software and labs has to land somewhere. Results in some cases means 4-5x drag on hardware infrastructure, Data Protection, VMware SW, and a combination of Dell Tech services. Positioning Pivotal solutions for customers looking to keep pace with the market and compete with fast startup companies offers BIG benefits for you. 

Craig Steel, Pivotal’s GM, Dell Tech Strategy &amp; Operations and Garrett Hartney, Dell EMC’s Business Development Manager, hosted the Dell EMC EMEA Power Hour &lt;[[https://emccorp.webex.com/emccorp/lsr.php?RCID=d74572be3f3e469ea1687dfc4fbfbe59]]&gt; last week, which I highly recommend 
checking out. When you identify a good prospect, send a request via the Pivotal Opportunity Registration &lt;[[http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/4243153/d5679a47c95anewsletter]]&gt; tool to gain support from a Pivotal rep.


 


 



 


 


5. Gartner on Container Management
 
A Competitive Landscape on Container Management Software was published by Gartner last week featuring Pivotal-VMware as one of 6 vendors including Docker and RedHat. Gartner states that customers are “turning to vendor-based container management solutions b/c they are perceived as assuring stability and governance (versus community-based/open source solutions).” 

PKS allows devs to go fast while offering operations teams a stable, easy to manage, and secure by default container platform that integrates with on-prem or public cloud 
infrastructure. Still asking What is Kubernetes &lt;[[https://blog.rackspace.com/kubernetes-explained-for-business-leaders]]&gt;? Rackspace actually does a great job explaining k8s for business leaders.
