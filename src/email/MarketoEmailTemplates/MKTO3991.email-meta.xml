    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 
Thank you for attending the Pivotal Cloud Native Roadshow in Paris on July 7th, 2016. We hope our event provided you clear perspective on the process and technology of Cloud Native organizations. 

 We have made our presentation slides available here &lt;[[https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BwA78Sj43bSPQ3ZxNUJBQUcxUDQ&amp;usp=sharing]]&gt;.

Please take a few minutes to share some feedback &lt;[[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1TF1aDReykgo6IkCG3KNBb60CjQkoL9qKpsyMHDBp7wQ/viewform]]&gt; about the event so we can continue to improve the experience you have with Pivotal.

If you are interested in having Pivotal present cloud native content to your organization or want to learn more about Pivotal, contact us &lt;[[mailto:emea_isr@pivotal.io]]&gt; to schedule a follow up with our team.
