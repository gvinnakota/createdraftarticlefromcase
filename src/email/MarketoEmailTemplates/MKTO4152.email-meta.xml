    <subject>10/20 Webinar - How to make cars smarter: A step towards self-driving cars</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://pivotal.io/big-data/webinar/how-to-make-cars-smarter]]&gt;
Hello, 

We are moving towards the reality of self-driving cars, but we are still years away from fully autonomous vehicles. In the meantime, however, there are a number of things we can do to make cars smarter in order to improve the lives of drivers. We can use data and analytics, for example, to prevent breakdowns and predict problems before they occur. Technology can also help cars achieve better performance in extreme situations like hydroplaning. 

 The reality is that data collected by car sensors is underused today. Join us on Thursday, October 20th, at 11:00am PDT when we will examine:

 - How to detect patterns in massive amounts of connected car data. 
 - Use cases for connected car applications, such as predicting failure of parts and subsystems before they occur. 
 - How to apply analytics in real time to help drivers avoid dangerous situations. 
 - How to leverage independent data sources to increase predictive value. 

Deep Dive: In the second half of the webinar we will give an actual example of how we apply big data technology to this problem.
