    <subject>Thank you for joining us at the Pivotal &amp; Microsoft Executive Dinner!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello,

Thank you for being a part of the Cloud-Native Roadshow in Boston. We hope our event provided you with a clear perspective on the process and technology it takes to become a cloud-native organization.

We have made the presentation slides available for you:


 - Item 1 &lt;[[link1]]&gt;
 - Item 2 &lt;[[link2]]&gt;



If you are interested in having Pivotal present cloud-native content to your organization or want to learn more about Pivotal, contact us at fieldevents@pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:fieldevents@pivotal.io]]&gt; to schedule a follow up with our team.

Thank you again for joining us!
 The Pivotal Team</textOnly>
