EDITOR WELCOME

The Year of Pivotal

Steve Casale &lt;[[https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1033819-stephencasale]]&gt;, Sr. Manager, Corporate Communications
It was cool the past few weeks to see our deepening ties with Ford as a signal of an industry’s strategic pivot to digital (Ford is leveraging the whole Pivotal portfolio). Just as interesting though was the broader media focus on the nuts and bolts of agile  &lt;[[http://www.cio.com/article/3016017/developer/ford-draws-on-pivotal-to-reshape-developer-culture.html]]&gt;as the new 
‘how’ in the era of cloud services. With CloudCredo joining the party &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform/press-release/pivotal-bolsters-its-cloud-native-platform-team-with-acquisition-of-cloudcredo]]&gt;, Pivotal now offers more responses to the cloud native lifestyle than our like-minded peers.

One of our Pivotal evangelists likens the proliferation of cloud services to the Cambrian 
explosion, when most of the earth’s animals appeared on the fossil record (I’m a sucker for these analogs). But a parallel struggle for a standard bearer is already underway. Our banner is cloud native, and we’re closing 2015 with a darn good case that Pivotal is synonymous with all of the things that could put us at the top of the food chain.

We weigh in more than usual on culture in this final issue of the year. In our Business Update, Joe Militello reports on the final Pulse survey of 2015, with results that reflect pride in our culture. Eric Schmalzbauer shows us what Movember &lt;[[https://www.movember.com/]]&gt; is all about, and how he and New York became a fundraising force through haircuts and bad mustaches.

Lastly, here’s to dialing down for a few days, to the 900 pages of speculative fiction that I probably won’t have time to finish, and to a happy and safe New Year for all.

Peace.

Pivotal Pulse—A Stronger Culture
Joe Militello &lt;[[https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/937505-joemilitello]]&gt;, VP, People
We wrapped the fourth Pivotal Pulse survey &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/departments/human-resources/pivotal-pulse-survey]]&gt; with a solid participation of 60% of those invited. This completes a year of survey results that roughly covered all of Pivotal. Sent each quarter to a random selection of 25% of our staff, Pulse has given us a reliable feedback loop that helps us continuously improve and build upon the Pivotal experience.



Overall scores were again strong, and the summary of the results from Pulse 4 are:



Strengths



	- While a belief and confidence in the future of Pivotal, along with your motivation to help Pivotal succeed was always strong, scores here showed the most gains.
	- Sirota, our survey consultant, notes that relative to other companies in its database, our scores show that we excel in providing a real opportunity to grow your skills.
	- Scores on managerial effectiveness (which has been a key focus area) continue to improve.



Improvement Areas



	- We continue to help managers on the basics, specifically in giving feedback, and in treating all with respect.
	- We’re putting more focus on diversity and fostering inclusion, where different experiences and views are welcome, and where you feel comfortable speaking up.
	- You want to hear more about Pivotal’s strategy, and you’d like to see improvements in our processes.
	- You would like a clearer sense of your career progression, and on the learning opportunities available to you.



The results, details, recommendations, and next steps from Pulse 4, can be found here &lt;[[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JKsckzfMisVsGUVruv-YVYWKz3l3sQc5sbVIej9gh14/edit]]&gt;.



With a full cycle complete, starting in 2016 we’ll work with teams to determine if the survey continues as is, or to make enhancements to the process, questions, or cadence. Please reach out to your manager, HR Business partner, or to me with suggestions or questions.



And have a terrific and restful holiday season!

Introducing PEZ, Pivotal’s Federated Cloud
Patrick Noia &lt;[[https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1112866-patricknoia]]&gt;, Sr. Manager, Cloud Services and Platforms
In June of this year we launched Pivotal Elastic Zones (i.e., PEZ), Pivotal’s new internal Cloud Service. The goal of PEZ is to offer a home-grown, cost-effective, and internal cloud platform as an alternative to external providers. To this end, PEZ offers scalable cloud capacity that can grow along with the needs of the enterprise. It will better facilitate Pivotal’s constant and growing demand for cloud resources.



Another big goal of PEZ is to provide a wider platform to dog-food our own products, work through bugs, and send real-time usage information to product teams that will help us improve our entire product portfolio.



Though still in beta, the Cloud Platform team has been busy at work over the past six months building new services, improving existing ones, and expanding PEZ&apos;s global footprint. We recently added three new services to our portfolio, vSphere-as-a-service, PCFaaS and Project Photon &lt;[[https://blogs.vmware.com/cloudnative/introducing-photon/]]&gt;, which is a joint development effort with VMware. We’ve also expanded the platform by a factor of three while maintaining a rigorous upgrade schedule.



We’re pleased to announce that PEZ is now Pivotal&apos;s first international cloud with the launch of our EMEA Cloud in Cork, Ireland. PEZ will soon be global when our Shanghai Cloud comes online in early 2016. This global federation of cloud services and platforms will create more agility and flexibility as Pivotal and its worldwide customer base grow.



PEZ is also making a huge impact externally, enabling our sales and professional services teams deliver live product demos that have been used for trade shows and customer engagements, such as: JavaOne, SpringOne, Audi, Honeywell, Staples, Citi, FedEx, Dish, and VMworld, with more growing everyday.



The past six months have been very exciting, but there are bigger things in store for 2016. It’s going to be epic! We’ll keep you posted, and in the meantime, feel free to reach out to me at pnoia@pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:pnoia@pivotal.io]]&gt; if you want to learn more.
Customer Spotlight
Cloud Native, Academy Backed!
Back in April, NBCUniversal (NBCU) selected Pivotal Cloud Foundry &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/platform]]&gt; to drive their Cloud Native platform and digital transformation. To accelerate adoption and maximize staff efficiency, NBCU invested in exclusive on-site training from the Pivotal Academy, and we held a Developing applications with Pivotal Cloud Foundry &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/academy#developing-applications-with-cloud-foundry]]&gt; class for NBCU developers. The Pivotal team garnered outstanding scores from NBCU for instructor knowledge, quality of materials, overall. Needless to say, they left satisfied.



Pivotal Academy sat down with the NBCU leadership to talk about the role training played in their deployment. Check out the talk with NBCU Vaidy Kothandaraman, Director of Open Platform Technology, in this interview published on the Pivotal blog &lt;[[https://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal-cloud-foundry/case-studies/nbcuniversal-uses-training-to-accelerate-cloud-native-journey]]&gt;. And please invite your customers to learn more about what’s new and current in our hands-on trainings at Pivotal  Academy &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/academy]]&gt;.



Lessons From the Other Side of App Development


 Think you’ve heard every story of transformation and tales of woe from old-school IT groups steeped in waterfall?



Think again!



You haven’t seen anything until you’ve pulled back the curtain on the inner workings of the IRS &lt;[[https://www.irs.gov/]]&gt; (Internal Revenue Service). For some, they may be the US government’s least popular agency, but to the agency’s credit, they are nothing if not self aware, and now the IRS is sharing their unique experience engaging Pivotal Labs. Watch &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_-38Eia2cA]]&gt; the IRS and Pivotal’s Lauren Gilchrist present at the Lean Startup Conference &lt;[[http://leanstartup.co/]]&gt; about the external web work being created to bring the IRS out of its 1960’s application culture, and into the modern world of development. It’s a great example of how to work successfully with a large agency or nonprofit. 
PEOPLE
A Movember to Remember
Eric Schmalzbauer &lt;[[https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1032491-ericschmalzbauer]]&gt;, Senior Business Development Manager, Pivotal Labs
Continuing the fairly recent Pivotal tradition of Movember &lt;[[https://au.movember.com/mospace/network/view/id/45677]]&gt;, Pivotal NYC wrapped up Movember 2015 with another very successful fundraising campaign.



What&apos;s Movember? Many know it&apos;s the reason you saw so many Pivots in your local offices growing sketchy mustaches. Movember raises funds and awareness around men&apos;s health issues.



For me, issues on men’s health are very personal. Approximately three years ago my father passed away from prostate cancer. I&apos;ve been a part of the team (Pivotal NYC &lt;[[http://moteam.co/pivotal-nyc]]&gt;) that introduced Movember to this office for several years, which started around the time my dad was diagnosed with cancer.



For this year’s campaign, Pivotal &lt;[[http://monetwork.co/Pivotal]]&gt; raised over $15,000, with Pivotal NYC &lt;[[http://moteam.co/pivotal-nyc]]&gt; delivering more than $9,300 (up from $6,200 in 2014). We also thank the Pivotal Toronto, San Francisco and Santa Monica offices for also raising funds.



Special thanks go to Andy O&apos;Brien, Mike Dalessio, and Michael Schubert, who all matched funds for each person in New York who volunteered to get a mohawk to bring Movember to a close… in this case bringing back a past tradition.





Staches’ and ‘hawks. The Movember wrecking crew.




All in the family: Your author with some help from the family.



The Pivotal NYC &lt;[[http://moteam.co/pivotal-nyc]]&gt; team raised $1,000 in the final hours on the final day of Movember… now that’s a pretty good close!



One of our local client engineers in New York also volunteered to get a mohawk. Clearly, we&apos;re changing the way the world builds software, AND the face of men&apos;s health. ;-)



Looking forward to Movember 2016!

Am part of the recently formed Enterprise Transformation Practice. What do we do? We help our customers drive agile principles and practices throughout their organizations by looking at not only technology solutions but also people, process, and structure.
Working with our transformation customers most of the time. Or in the SF office helping to develop the Transformation offerings or supporting our sales team at customer briefings.
Delivering transformation services to some of the Transformation team’s first clients—Home Depot, Ford, Allstate and Humana, to name a few. I&apos;m also helping the team hire great people.
I love to run, cycle, and do other torturous workouts with a crew of friends. I&apos;m also an animal lover, and I walk dogs for my local animal shelter when I&apos;m home. It’s a also a time of year where where I’m yelling at the television to  encourage my beloved Kansas City Chiefs to play better (I think it helps)!





Among friends (l to r): Taking in Mt. Whitney; Talking a walk with a rescue buddy.
I&apos;ve been to 46 states and 38 countries...Can&apos;t wait to see more!
Has a unique set of offerings that really help companies transform how they operate and deliver comprehensive value for their customers. Adding enterprise transformation services to the mix sets us apart from many software companies, to help us deliver unique value that very few companies can match.
