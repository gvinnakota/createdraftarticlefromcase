    <subject>2/9 Webinar: Cloud Data at epic scale with DataStax Enterprise and Pivotal Cloud Foundry</subject>

Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 
 DataStax Enterprise (DSE) contains a highly distributed NoSQL database - a perfect fit for a highly distributed cloud platform. Pivotal Cloud Foundry makes provisioning access to your existing DSE clusters a self-service exercise for developers and operators. Spring, .NET or any Pivotal Cloud Foundry managed application can then connect and use this Apache Cassandra-based technology as either as OLTP system of record, or read-intensive datastore. 
 
Join Pieter Humphrey and Gilbert Lau &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/cloud-data-at-epic-scale-with-datastax-enterprise-and-pivotal-cloud-foundry]]&gt; for a brief overview of Cassandra technology, discussion of business benefits and use cases with Pivotal Cloud Foundry, demos of the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Service Broker for DSE, and a look at some proof-of-concept work to deploy a fully BOSH 2.0 managed DSE Tile on Pivotal Cloud Foundry. 
 
More details below:
 
Date: Thursday, February 9, 2017
Time: 10:00am PST / 1:00pm EST
