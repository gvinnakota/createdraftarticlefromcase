    <subject>2/7/18 Webinar: It’s Not Just Request/Response: Understanding Event-driven Microservices</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar, It’s Not Just Request/Response: Understanding Event-driven Microservices &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/feb-7-it-s-not-just-request-response-understanding-event-driven-microservices-webinar?utm_source=digest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=event-driven-cornelia-q118]]&gt;, on 
February 7, 2018. 

Why all of the recent buzz around event-driven architectures? Software solutions have implemented event-driven patterns for some time, using message brokers such as 
RabbitMQ or ActiveMQ. Use of these message brokers is so ubiquitous that every J2EE platform such as WebSphere or WebLogic embeds one.

What is new is that we are reexamining event-driven approaches in the context of microservices. On the one hand, microservices don’t change things too much—the scenarios that called for message queuing in the past remain. Where eventing starts to get interesting is when we start applying it to scenarios we once used a request/response model. We can turn the processing on its head by propagating events through a network of microservices. Doing so can yield more autonomous microservices and more resilient systems. 

In this session Cornelia Davis, Senior Director of Technology at Pivotal, will examine this approach describing the architectural tenets and analyzing the benefits and tradeoffs. By the end of this webinar, you will have some very concrete techniques that you can immediately put into practice.
