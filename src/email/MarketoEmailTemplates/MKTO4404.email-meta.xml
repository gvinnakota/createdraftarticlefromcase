Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 
Does your organisation recognise the critical importance of software to retain and attract customers, drive new business models, and maintain your competitive advantage? Are you looking to modernise the way you do application development and operations through better tools, processes, and culture to accelerate your speed to market and meet customer expectations? If so, Pivotal invites you to a series of events designed to help you transform your organisation into a cloud-native enterprise. 

 We’ve mapped out the most common topics we get asked about when working with organisations embarking on the cloud-native journey and packaged these topics into an event specifically designed to meet the needs of specific stakeholders within your organization. Our Cloud-Native Transformation Forum will be held at our London offices on 13 December from 09:30–16:30. 

 Why attend?

 - Learn principles and practices of successful software-based disruptors 
 - Gain a thorough understanding of cloud-native: why does it matter, what does it look like, and how do you get there 
 - Ensure that your cloud-native transformation goes smoothly with an appreciation of the perspectives of different roles and teams in your organization 
 - Learn theory and practical elements, tips, gotchas, best practices and case studies from organisations that have already adopted cloud-native principles

All attendees will receive a copy of Matt Stine’s book, ‘Migrating to Cloud-Native Application Architectures.’
