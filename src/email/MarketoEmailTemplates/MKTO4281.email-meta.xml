Steve Casale, Sr. Manager, Corporate Communications
Speaking to a group of recent hires, a Pivotal engineer offered an analog on digitization. If you watch the news every day, he said, it all seems bad, but if you view events over time, you find progress. This can sound naive in some quarters. But if you agree that software mediates pretty much everything, it makes more sense: You accept the quotidian pinpricks of change to stay healthy over time, or you don’t and face the hammer blows of disruption.

This week PCF became generally available on the Google Cloud Platform &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/]]&gt;. Helping companies leverage PCF to build and run cloud native apps from this formidable piece of cloud real estate—annealed in the fires of YouTube, Gmail, and Google Maps—means Pivotal is now central to every major cloud initiative.

In this issue, our &quot;All Things Product&quot; contribution underscores that value. Sean Lee provides the backdrop on how the prominent Asian bank, DBS, is tying Pivotal to their software-centric business strategy. In &quot;Labs+Culture&quot;, London-based Pivot Maria Ntalla tugs on the legacy of British mathematician Ada Lovelace—who nearly two centuries became programmer number one—in an article on the importance of women in STEM, 



Pivotal: Helping you avoid a certain kind of spiral (source: XKCD)

Pivotal might seem doctrinaire to the newcomer. But the humane subtext is helping others build sustainable code with sustainable teams. And freeing software teams from the hamster wheel of IT processes that work at cross purposes is not a bad way for anyone to understand this company.

Enjoy.
DBS Win: Pivotal beats the incumbent




Sean Lee, Head of Business Development, APJ
Singapore-based DBS bank &lt;[[http://www.dbs.com/]]&gt; has 280 branches spread throughout 18 Asian markets, with a strong footprint in China, Singapore, and Malaysia. While it boasts a strong retail presence, DBS&apos; prominence rests on its wealth management and private banking services.
Financial services is a fast-growing vertical for Pivotal in Asia, where a disruptive fintech movement is turning a conservative landscape on its head. Commercial lending is big business here, and fintechs and others (such as China’s Alibaba &lt;[[https://www.alibaba.com/]]&gt;) have been consumerizing the segment, carving out space with software-driven business models.

 


DBS largely understood that a successful future rests largely on a good digital strategy. On the retail front, that meant a fast and seamless experiences. On the commercial side, it meant automating cumbersome loan approval processes. At DBS—and other banks—commercial lending has traditionally been a manual, high-touch drill where the potential for human error is high.
When we first engaged DBS, they compared us with everyone. We knew of their reputation for being joined at the hip with IBM—and they were certainly being pitched Bluemix. Redhat was in there offering huge discounts, and DBS has also used the agile shop Thoughtworks on development projects. When the conversation became an &apos;apples-to-oranges&apos; features competition, it was hard to differentiate Pivotal.
We made two key inroads, which included some luck along the way when we acquired the respected Singapore-based design firm Neo. This got their attention. We further connected with the right stakeholders at the Asian Financial Services Congress &lt;[[http://www.ap.afscongress.com/]]&gt;. The theme and urgency financials felt around digitization was the right setting to take the &quot;value line” conversation to the C-Suite, and focus in their top business needs.
David Gledhill, DBS&apos; CIO, had already made noise about their sluggish monolithic IBM platform. Bill Cook met with Gledhill and shared what we&apos;re doing with our largest financial customers. The use cases made it to the CEO, and he was convinced enough to get key business functions in line, including the bank&apos;s head of risk. This is how we landed their commercial loans business—to deploy their credit risk systems on PCF, with a parallel engagement for Pivotal Labs Singapore.
We currently have a $1.7M deal for PCF software licensing, services, and Pivotal Labs. As they approach the next phase of migrating existing applications onto PCF, we expect an expansion of the platform.
Start Small 
How we started is important. We&apos;re co-developing a few modules within DBS&apos; key credit risk system through a typical Labs approach. At the same time, we&apos;re helping DBS shape their own innovation labs, where our team provides feedback in an environment that mimics a typical Labs facility. The DBS win is also a focal point around which we are building mindshare in APJ.
While Asia has been viewed as lagging behind North America in technology the past decade, the region embraced mobility very early and is quickly closing the digital gap. We&apos;re actively seeking enterprises in APJ that are on a common journey—ones that understand why they need to change and need the right cloud native platform and enabling partner. We&apos;re making inroads through this selective, qualified process, and DBS Bank fits perfectly in with this approach.

don&apos;t let tech miss out on its women




Maria Ntalla, Software Engineer, London
Last Tuesday was Ada Lovelace &lt;[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace]]&gt; Day. Celebrating the life and work of such an inspirational woman made me wonder: Almost two centuries after the world’s first programmer lived, what is the world doing to get more female technologists among its ranks? Why is it so important?
Quite simply, by missing out on women, the tech industry is losing out on innovation.
Roughly 50% of the customers of any product are women. Some products are focused entirely on women—think breast pumps or fertility tracking apps. Not including enough women in the development of these products delays advances in those areas. Moreover, be it for biological, social or other reasons, women tend to approach problems differently from men &lt;[[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rebecca-shambaugh/different-brains-differen_b_9480952.html]]&gt;. Diverse teams allow companies to find opportunities that a completely homogeneous team would not spot as easily.
Research &lt;[[http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/how-diversity-makes-us-more-empathetic/]]&gt; also shows that teams with more diverse representation develop more empathy.
In the broadest context, workplace diversity and inclusion have a way to go. Nonetheless, the dialogue and initiatives around workplace diversity are more vital than ever. The trick is to go from abstract statements to actionable statements.
So where to start? Say yes to opportunities. That might be leading a new project, offering training or coaching, or exploring a different part of your company for a while. Often this will mean getting out of your everyday job or maybe diverting slightly from your long term plan. It might make your stomach flip a little. But it will help you grow into a better, fuller person and open new avenues for you to explore.
Make it a point to know your stuff, and the best way you can do that is by collaborating, asking questions and voicing your doubts. One of the things I love most about working at Pivotal is how everyone I work with is so darn brilliant and helpful—making it a great place to learn something every single day. Stay curious about things you don’t yet know and be generous with your expertise.
And finally, share the love! This is a time of great change in terms of getting more girls into engineering studies and keeping more women into technology. There are many channels that promote diversity: from meetups for professionals to coaching workshops, to after-school clubs for children. Getting involved means you get to contribute to that change right here, right now.

Neha Batra, Software Engineer
At Pivotal I...
Work as an engineer at Pivotal Labs in SF. I fell in love with Pivotal’s methodologies in the interview and have been hooked since. I also co-organize our office’s monthly lightning talks with Maryam Labib!
You can find me...
Wearing bright colors, trucking too many beverages to/from my desk (hydrating? caffeinating? lacroixing? what will she do next??), or laughing too loudly with my pair. When I am not physically in the office you can find me on twitter &lt;[[https://twitter.com/nerdneha]]&gt;.
Currently, I am working on…
Wrapping up a project with a solar client where we are creating a newer version of their sales journey. It’s the first time our client’s had the option to incorporate their customer’s changes without having to start their process over to get calculation/visualization updates.
In my spare time…
I’m putting together events with Write/Speak/Code &lt;[[https://www.meetup.com/WriteSpeakCode-SFBay/]]&gt;, going to SoulCycle with a bunch of coworkers (one day we will take over the class!!), speaking at a few conferences/blogging &lt;[[http://nerdneha.tumblr.com/]]&gt; about things, and likely binging on a new tv show of choice (I’m almost done with Parks and Rec!). I also love mentoring people who are interested in public speaking and am working on a workshop curriculum to help a larger group!
Something you probably don’t know about me…
I love planning vacations, especially for groups. I’m the type of person to hook a Google Forms survey up to some unnecessary amount of Excel sheets in order to predict a budget, food purchases, and useful statistics to make decisions. My inner Ben Wyatt somehow thinks it’s really fun!

To me Pivotal…

 
A petri dish of innovation and iteration. I love how there’s no hesitation to question the norm and to have serious conversations on what we can do better and how we can be more inclusive. I’ve been constantly surprised by how many people have my back and want to see me succeed. People like this make me want to be an even better person and better coworker &lt;3.</textOnly>
