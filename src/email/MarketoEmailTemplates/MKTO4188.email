<p>Colleagues, <br /><br /> Facilities, HR, and other support departments have spent many hours coordinating the delivery of new Pivotal badges to Pivotal offices and to Pivotal staff in Dell/EMC offices, coworking spaces, client locations, and home offices.
 Most of you have received your new badges, and we're working to ensure that those who expect new badges receive them in a timely manner.
 <br /><br /> There will be a period of approximately one week where both your new and old badges will be active after the new badges are officially activated.
 This is a deliberate overlap to help colleagues who have not yet received badges to continue working with minimal interruption.
 <br /><br /> The new badges will be officially activated in these regions on the following dates:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>North America</strong> &ndash; Tuesday, September 27&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>EMEA</strong> &ndash; Monday, October 3&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>APJ</strong> &ndash; Monday, October 3&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>For colleagues in North America, your new badges are now active, <strong>so you should start to use your new badge immediately</strong>.
 Please do not discard your old badge.
 Return the old badge to your office concierge or administrator after the new badges are activated in your region.
 Real Estate &amp; Facilities will reach out to other remote or home-based employees with instructions on how to return their old badges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you expect a new badge but haven&rsquo;t received it yet, please complete this <a style="color: #059a91; text-decoration: none;" href="https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdodzSYzksM4pI2E5qWl__oOos1oM-eYTSZx52Z7WTLEXr8pw/viewform">Google Form</a> as soon as possible.
 Based on your answers, we'll do our best to track down where your badge may have been sent, and coordinate delivery to you.
 Once again, you will still be able to use your old Pivotal badge for approximately a week after your region's official activation date.
 <br /><br /> Thank you for your cooperation throughout this rebadging process.
 If you have any questions or concerns on badging, submit a ticket to <a style="color: #059a91; text-decoration: none;" href="mailto:ask@pivotal.io">ask@pivotal.io</a>, speak with your local workplace concierge, or reach out to me at <a style="color: #059a91; text-decoration: none;" href="mailto:rmccormick@pivotal.io">rmccormick@pivotal.io</a>.
