Children live intensely in the present. Their diversions and whims can seem like live or die moments that evaporate as quickly as they&apos;ve formed. I&apos;ve been grateful this past week, in the wake of a tumultuous US election, for these little people. Their insistent present-mindedness pulled me through my post-election fog, reminding me that we are not here for ourselves alone.

 
Pivotal folks spent time this past week reaching out—listening and talking through a tangle of apprehension and reactions. In its support of a rainbow arrow of opinions and the space to let them fly, Pivotal showed a generous side.
I&apos;m pleased that the stories this issue cover a similarly wide latitude. John Jahnke summarizes the PCF and Azure partnership that extends our connectivity in the multi-cloud nexus. In Labs + Culture, Pivotal pro—and newsletter newcomer—Lauren Gilchrist offers insights from the unique and well considered work of the Washington D.C. office and their government clients. 
Finally, the Pivotal Brand team has a &apos;Help&apos;: They&apos;ve put together a thoughtful survey on the Pivotal brand, and they&apos;d appreciate your taking it before the end of November. It takes about 20 minutes or so, and you can find it here &lt;[[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/6KV5TVC]]&gt;.

Enjoy.

John Jahnke, Vice President, Microsoft Alliance
It&apos;s been a big year for our partnership with Microsoft. We recently went GA with PCF 1.8 &lt;[[http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-8/customizing/azure.html]]&gt; on Azure, and Pivotal&apos;s growing partnership with Microsoft brings many positives to Pivotal and Microsoft customers &lt;[[https://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal-cloud-foundry/products/pivotal-cloud-foundry-goes-global-with-microsoft-azure]]&gt;.
Some might not be aware that Microsoft Azure is the second largest and fastest growing public cloud &lt;[[http://fortune.com/2016/08/04/amazon-microsoft-cloud-race/]]&gt;, and quickly becoming one of the most requested public clouds from our customers. As trusted partners of enterprises for decades, Microsoft has developed deep relationships with clients. With their strong shift to the public cloud a few years ago they&apos;ve earned the trust of customers. Azure is a thriving, rapidly expanding cloud alternative that builds from technologies like SQL Server, Active Directory and .NET. Their global reach is consistently brought up as a differentiator, and as something enterprises strongly desire.
In short, with Pivotal&apos;s platform is now at the heart of developer velocity and multi-cloud choice, Microsoft&apos;s public cloud is a natural partner.
Our ties with Microsoft stretch back to early 2015, when Microsoft contributed a Cloud Provider Interface (CPI) for Azure to OSS Cloud Foundr &lt;[[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/try-cloud-foundry-on-azure-today/]]&gt;y. Fast forward to today, where the collaboration has grown to a dedicated Microsoft engineering team working hand-in-hand with Pivotal, seven customers in production (Ford, Manulife, FedEx, Dell, The Gap, GE, and Merrill Corp), and a joint pipeline of over 170 of the world&apos;s largest companies as prospects. And all this came before we officially announced PCF GA!
Microsoft also became an investor &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/corporate/press-release/pivotal-announces-series-c-financing]]&gt; during our recent Series-C financing round in May. At that time, Scott Guthrie, the Microsoft EVP in charge of Azure and SQL Server noted—historically, some would say—that “Our priority is ensuring that Microsoft Azure is the best place to run Java applications using Pivotal Cloud Foundry.”
Customers are excited by the joint advances we&apos;re making for their benefit, including dedicated support and escalation channels between the Azure and Pivotal support organization. We&apos;re also focused on product integrations with service brokers &lt;[[https://www.cloudfoundry.org/azure-service-brokers-released-today/]]&gt; and more joint engineering investments.
The road ahead looks promising. Joint teams are working on several strategic deals that we anticipate landing in Q4. Daimler, Boeing, McKesson, Scotiabank, and American Airlines are just some of the big names the two organizations are collaborating on. We&apos;ve had amazing support from the PCF engineering, support, business operations and legal teams as we&apos;ve gotten things off the ground this year—and I can’t thank all those that touch this partnership enough for their support.
Expect more great news here in the month to come. We have a big direct and even bigger extended team supporting our partnership—head to our Inside Pivotal site &lt;[[https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/global-ecosystem/m]]&gt; for the latest resources and information, or email Azure-inquiry@pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:Azure-inquiry@pivotal.io]]&gt; to reach the entire alliance team.

Lauren Gilchrist, Office Director, Pivotal Washington D.C.
Thanks to Adam Bray and Laurel Gray, who helped write this article. 

What is it like to use the web without a mouse, or to navigate the internet with a screen reader like many legally blind do? These and other questions are a daily part of how we understand user needs in Pivotal&apos;s Washington D.C. offices.

By law, most US federal agencies—civilian, defense, or intelligence—must build software that meets 508 compliance standards &lt;[[http://www.508checker.com/what-is-508-compliance]]&gt;. It stipulates that software must be useable for those who access the web through assistive technologies such as screen readers, voice-to-speech controls, and screen magnifiers, or who have specific vision or mobility needs. A full 100% of our current clients in Washington D.C. are government institutions, so 508 compliance has significantly influenced our teams and their expertise.

Here are five principles you can take away now for projects with 508 or similar accessibility requirements:

Start with the basics

 We’ve found it best for the entire team (clients and Pivots) to get a crash course on basic principles and best practices upfront. Check out 7 things every designer should know about accessibility &lt;[[https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/7-things-every-designer-needs-to-know-about-accessibility-64f105f0881b#.31tffz7fj]]&gt;, and Invision’s blog post &lt;[[http://blog.invisionapp.com/guide-web-content-accessibility/]]&gt; on web accessibility, for starters. 18F&apos;s accessibility guide &lt;[[https://pages.18f.gov/accessibility/]]&gt; and Vox&apos;s product accessibility guide &lt;[[http://accessibility.voxmedia.com/]]&gt; are good additional resources.

 
Understand what &quot;done&quot; looks like
Most government institutions have existing processes to ensure that 508 standards are met before an application goes into production. Does someone test the app? To what standards? Are they able to be part of the process of identifying what success looks like? Can they delegate someone who is?
Identify targets upfront
Which browsers, assistive technologies, and devices are you using for acceptance? JAWS, VoiceOver, and NVDA are the most popular screen readers, and their behavior can vary significantly.
DC Pivots Gabriel Ramirez (L) and Adam Bray (R) testing features while listening to JAWS screenreader.
Bake 508 into practices early
The longer you wait to bake in 508 criteria, the more rework you&apos;ll do. If you embrace 508 as a constraint upfront and modify processes to ensure that a user leveraging an assistive technology is treated as a first-class citizen, you save a lot of frustration for your team and client (we&apos;ve learned this the hard way). This likely entails user stories that include accessibility criteria, and accessibility tests in your test suite (tools such as Pa11y &lt;[[http://pa11y.org/]]&gt; can help with this).
If possible, have the agreed upon assistive technologies installed on everyone’s machines for faster feedback loops. Otherwise, developers must deploy before testing, which adds time.
Bring in an expert
We find that a 508 subject expert is needed full-time during discovery and the first few weeks of writing user stories, with that commitment decreasing quickly as the team ramps up. We&apos;ve evolved to point where we bake the acceptance criteria for an unsighted user (screen reader), a low vision user (zoomtext), and low-mobility user (voice-to-navigate technology) directly into our user stories. While this adds scope at first and is a steep learning curve, it saves a ton of rework later on.
Considering assistive technologies has broadened how our DC team understands digital user access needs, and these lessons are useful for any number of projects. Associate Director David Varvel gave a core practice talk for clients and Pivots on the basics of 508. Pivots Laurel Gray (PM) and Mariesa Dale (PD) have subsequently created a getting started guide to building accessible products &lt;[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gbMyiEKlkmaZvSvEcJ0GRXy8OUGeVH8ZNcq_x-rdq3s/edit]]&gt;, with an #accessibility channel &lt;[[https://pivotal.slack.com/messages/accessibility/]]&gt; on Slack. We&apos;re looking to share more resources soon, so stay tuned.

Dat Tran, Principal Data Scientist, Berlin
At Pivotal I...
Am part of Pivotal Labs helping clients to build smart, data-driven apps in a balanced team. Since joining the company, I’ve had the opportunity to work on many interesting projects such as aquaplaning (or hydroplaning) prediction, time-to-delivery prediction, and customer profiling.
You can find me...
In the Berlin office which is probably located in the best city of the world! (It&apos;s poor but very sexy) ;)
Currently, I am working on…
A dashboard for a large automaker. I’m helping the team to process large amounts of data via cloud computing (PySpark on AWS). 
In my spare time…
I enjoy eating in good restaurants, traveling, blogging, and reading. I love to take pictures of good food and share it on Instagram :)
Something you probably don’t know about me…
I’ve worked as a waiter for years in my family’s restaurant business: http://www.sy-restaurant.de/ &lt;[[http://www.sy-restaurant.de/]]&gt;. Check it out if you happen to be in Berlin!

To me Pivotal is…
 
A collection of highly talented individuals who have their own mind but we all share the same passion which is to build great things together!
