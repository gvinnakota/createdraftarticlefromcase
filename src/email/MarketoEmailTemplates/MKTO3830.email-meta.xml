    <subject>Welcome Lionel Lim</subject>
    <textOnly>All,

Today we’re announcing that Lionel Lim is joining Pivotal as our new Vice President and Managing Director of the Asia-Pacific Japan (APJ) region, effective immediately and reporting to me.

Highlighted by high growth (China), seasoned (Australia, Korea, Japan, and Singapore), and emerging economies, APJ is a dynamic region at the front-edge of change, and we’re rapidly expanding our presence and customer portfolio here.

Since January, the APJ country leaders have been temporarily reporting to me. The arrival of Lionel gives this remarkable team a proven leader with extensive customer relationships, and a deep understanding of the region. Lionel will lead our business in the region, with our APJ country leaders reporting directly to him.

I have known Lionel for a long time, dating back to the meteoric rise of Sun Microsystems under Scott McNealy. Lionel has a well-earned reputation for both his personal touch and business acumen. He also brings an extensive track record of results at all stages of growth—from startup to hyper growth to global enterprise.

He has successfully led teams at CA Technologies, Sun Microsystems, and Hewlett-Packard Company (HP). As President and COO of Sun (Asia), he was instrumental in driving Sun’s rapid growth across the region. Lionel also serves on the board of Singapore-based, M1, one of the most innovative telcos in the region.

We’re confident that Lionel and the APJ team will help us rapidly expand our customer base and partner ecosystem in the world’s largest and fastest-growing region.

Here’s what Lionel had to say about Pivotal: “I’m delighted to be 
here. Pivotal’s customer focus, its collaborative and empowered teams, and the transformational effect it has on customers come from a unique set of values and principles. I’ve seen how the company brings these principles together across the company and with customers, and I’m looking forward to working with our great team in APJ to help customers succeed through the Pivotal way!&quot;

Lionel will be based in Singapore, and has started reaching out to customers, so please join me in welcoming him to Pivotal.
