<p dir="ltr">As I look back on our first three years, I am so proud of all you&rsquo;ve done.<br /><br />We continue to pioneer a disciplined and opinionated approach to modern software development.
          We have built the modern cloud platform on which the world&rsquo;s most important companies are building their digital futures.
          We give many of the world&rsquo;s biggest enterprises the widest set of modern tools to master analytics.<br /><br />Software is remaking the world, and Pivotal is remaking software.<br /><br />Earlier today, on the heels of our third birthday, we announced that Pivotal raised a Series C investment round, highlighted by $253 million in new cash, led by Ford, with the participation of  
new         investor Microsoft as well as all our current investors.
          It&rsquo;s a huge endorsement of the transformative nature of our work.<br /><br />We&rsquo;re just getting started.
          This influx of cash gives us the ability to continue building great technology and expanding our global reach.<br /><br />But today&rsquo;s announcement is not just about the investment.
          It&rsquo;s about who we are and what we stand for.
          Keep in mind that our <a style="color: #3ea7bc; text-decoration: none;" href="https://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal/features/pivots-are-what-set-pivotal-apart">values got us here</a>.
          Keep doing what you&rsquo;re doing.<br /><br />Happy birthday to us all.</p>
