Organisations adopt a multi-cloud approach for many reasons—regulatory interest, price arbitrage, flexibility, choice, data sovereignty, varying business requirements—the list goes on.

However, from our conversations with several CIOs, we’ve learned that avoiding cloud lock-in is a primary driver behind a multi-cloud strategy. So what is cloud lock-in and what can you do to avoid being locked in?

Attend this webinar as we examine the topic of cloud lock-in and how to operate in multiple clouds, specifically looking at:
- The commercial, technological capability, process, and developer experience aspects of cloud lock-in
- Mitigating approaches for dealing with cloud lock-in
- Four key aspects to effectively executing a multi-cloud strategy
- Common multi-cloud patterns

We look forward to seeing you there.
