<p><span style="font-family: 'courier,monospace', courier,monospace;">Hi&nbsp;{{lead.First Name:default=there}}, <br><br> How can you drive outcomes that your customers actually <em>want</em> faster? <br><br> If you’re serious about digital transformation, innovation, and cloud, keep reading. Every person involved with your company’s transition to a software-defined business should attend <a href="https://springoneplatform.io/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=s1p-therese-stowell&amp;utm_term=q218" target="_blank" id="" style="color: #00ae9e; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 400;">SpringOne Platform</a>, this September 24–27 at the Gaylord National Resort in the Washington, D.C. area. <br><br> Who might that be exactly and what will they gain? <br><br> <strong>Line of business managers</strong> get a better understanding of cost savings, speed to market, and new ways to engage with customers who, powered by software, can accelerate their business goals to meet&nbsp; demand. <br><br> <strong>Architects</strong> learn how to architect modern cloud apps, and potentially refactor apps to be hosted on Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). <br><br> <strong>App devs</strong> walk away from SpringOne Platform knowing how to write bleeding-edge microservices applications using Spring Boot, .NET, and more—that’s how you create business-differentiating software. Leave the boilerplate code behind and start writing code that matters. <br><br> <strong>Ops teams</strong> understand how to automate their day 2 tasks and provide platform as a service to developers. By attending this event, they’ll learn how to perform day 2 ops efficiently, upgrades, and infrastructure patching—and that makes operations a lot more fun. </span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier,monospace', courier,monospace;"><strong>CIOs/CTOs and Chief Digital Officers</strong> get love, this event isn’t just for practitioners. It’s an opportunity for key decision makers to learn how to build a digital presence for their company by engaging with senior leaders from companies who’ve already invested in their transformation journey. Think companies like Allstate, Ford, Boeing, and others. <br><br> <strong>CISOs and Infrastructure security practitioners</strong> learn how to modernize their practices to realize efficiencies in some of their most burdensome processes, like patching, credential management, and compliance. Adopting a “secure by default” posture enables security teams to position themselves as accelerating innovation rather than hindering it. <br><br> By bringing <strong>your full stack</strong>—everyone involved with your digital transformation will come away with a shared frame of reference, energized to make the transformation happen, and get closer as a team. <br><br> I can personally attest that last year’s show was amazing—and not just because I got to <a href="https://youtu.be/dpiKq-wPSMg?t=78?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=s1p-therese-stowell&amp;utm_term=q218" target="_blank" id="" style="color: #00ae9e; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 400;">deliver a keynote</a> where I explained how leader-follower works in distributed computing! I saw&nbsp;many insightful talks, caught up with old friends, and made new ones. This year’s event should be even better. <br><br> I hope to see you and your entire team in September. <br><br> Regards, <br>Therese <br><br> And as a special bonus, feel free to use the code <strong>S1P200_TStowell</strong> when you <a href="https://2018.event.springoneplatform.io/register?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=s1p-stowell-2018" target="_blank" id="" style="color: #00ae9e; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 400;">register</a> to save $200 off your SpringOne Platform pass. <br><br></span></p>
