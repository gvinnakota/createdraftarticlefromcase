    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 
 
 The first PCF User group meeting of 2019 is just around the corner!

Led by JP White, Director of Engineering at Dicks Sporting Goods, join us for a engaging session on how DSG enlisted PCF and Pivotal Labs to shift their focus from project to product for the 2018 Holiday Season. Register here &lt;[[https://connect.pivotal.io/pcf-user-group-january-2019.html]]&gt;!

As a reminder all user group members in EMEA and North America are welcome to attend as these sessions are not recorded. Please make sure to follow our **new process** for user group meetings and register for each meeting with your work email. The Webex details for both meetings will be in your confirmation email, along with a way to download a calendar appointment. If you have any questions please reach out to Madison Schlegel at Mschlegel@pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:mail to: Mschlegel@pivotal.io]]&gt;.

Looking forward to seeing all of you!

Your host,
