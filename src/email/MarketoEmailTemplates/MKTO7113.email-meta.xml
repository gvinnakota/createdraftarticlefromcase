 We can’t confirm you at this event. It could be because the email domain you’ve used isn’t on the pre-approved list. 

Here are a couple of options:

Did you use your personal email address? 
Make sure you’re registering with your work email address.

 Are you a PCF user but not a PCF User Group member?
