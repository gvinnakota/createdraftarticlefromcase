    <subject>Pivotal Quarter in Review and Message from Joe Tucci</subject>
    <textOnly>Confidential – For Internal Use Only

Colleagues,

As Joe Tucci&apos;s note below explains, the recent EMC and Dell announcement to combine the two organizations has been positively received by EMC Federation customers.

As we&apos;ve reached out to Pivotal customers, they too have shared their enthusiasm for Michael Dell, an industry icon and the original &quot;dorm room to board room&quot; entrepreneur. Michael Dell has also clearly stated that he is supportive of our mission &lt;https://drive.google.com/a/pivotal.io/file/d/0B9jgf3B_4mC8S00xdWcxNGU4eWM/view&gt; and the plan is to let Pivotal continue to operate as a fast-moving 
start-up with the intent to go public at the appropriate time.

Our growing momentum was recently captured in yesterday&apos;s EMC earnings announcement, where we reported an all-time record quarter in terms of annualized recurring revenue (ARR), which is an important measure of our Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data Suite subscription businesses. Our strong performance in third quarter of 2015 was the result of helping many of the world’s largest enterprises successfully expand their digital capabilities or undergo a full digital transformation.

For example, on Monday, we announced our work with Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz, helping them design and bring to life its first-ever connected car app that ushers in a new era of digital transformation. Christoph Hartung, Head of Connected Cars, Mercedes-Benz, said, “…With Pivotal we have minimized our innovation cycles and can now respond to changing market demands faster than ever before, both of which allowed us to develop a profound software culture in our 
transformational journey into a digital company. Our collaboration with Pivotal will define a new digital driving culture with state-of-the-art information technologies, online communication systems and automotive services.” The Mercedes me connected car app was created on Pivotal Cloud Foundry, using Pivotal Big Data Suite, 
and supercharged by Pivotal Labs’ modern approach to software development.

Congratulations on the strong results we’ve achieved together. We can all be proud of the quarter we just reported, and the work that keeps Pivotal at the forefront of transforming how the world build software.

A Message from Joe Tucci

Customers, Integration &amp; The Federation – My Thoughts On Week 1

I would like to share what I’ve been hearing from customers since our big announcement last Monday:

Customers are responding 
positively in the conversations I’m having. They see the logic of the EMC/Dell combination and are excited about the possibilities and what this means for their future… to have a strategic partner with more heft and relevance to their digital and IT transformations as they plan their strategies around software-defined data center, hybrid cloud, converged infrastructure, mobile and security. They understand how moving to a privately-controlled model will allow us to incubate young businesses and invest more for the long haul without the pressure of managing for quarter-end. Customers do ask about the debt expense, but remember that over the last three years, EMC alone has averaged approximately $3.5 billion annually on share repurchases and dividends. Furthermore, the collective cash flows of the combined company will allow it to keep investing heavily in R&amp;D and innovation, GTM and resources to provide first-class services and support to our customers. Customers also like the fact that our future breadth and scale means we will no longer be the “smallest of the big” tech companies. Upon closing, we will be a clear leader for enterprise technology, with significantly more product and technology revenues than our nearest competitor. That will ensure us a place on every consideration list for transformative IT projects. Additionally, our VCE customers are very happy to hear about our joint commitment with Cisco to VBlocks for the long haul!

Now that we have entered into a definitive merger agreement with Dell, we need to begin our planning for the post announcement integration activities 
while we continue to run the business.  It is important that we have a coordinated approach across our companies and business units and to help assure this I have asked Howard Elias to become the Federation integration leader.  Howard will report directly to me in this new role and become the primary interface with Dell on integration matters. We will form a steering committee along with a framework to help coordinate all the integration activities, and I ask  you to assign someone from your team to join this important effort.

Finally, to clarify what we announced last Monday: until the transaction closes, we must/will continue to operate our family of companies as we always have: with a laser focus on the success of our customers and growth. In doing so we will continue to refer to our combination of businesses as &quot;The (EMC2) Federation&quot; and as such we will continue to execute on our Federation solutions, technology collaborations related to Software-Defined Storage, CI, and Cloud Native Apps, and GTM plans/initiative under Jeff Casale. Both Michael Dell and Egon Durban from Silver Lake have said they see great value in our Federation model… it gives us focus of mission, an ability to attract and retain world class talent and collectively gives our customers a compelling vision for the future, without 
lock-in.

Thank you for your support and cooperation.

Best,

Joe Tucci
