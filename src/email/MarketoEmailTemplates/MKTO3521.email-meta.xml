    <subject>Pivotal Cloud Native Java Workshop Confirmation</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[http://pivotal.io/fr/event/forum-de-la-transformation-digitale]]&gt;
Thank you for signing up for the Pivotal Cloud Native Java workshop.
 
 Josh Long&apos;s workshop will be a very intensive live-coding demo with deep dive explanations on Spring framework, Spring Boot, microservices, Cloud Native Framework and Cloud Native Application concepts; with lots of insights shared on easiness provided by tools, 
frameworks and running platforms to create modern applications.
 
 The 2–3 hour sessions are not intended to be hands-on exercises, per se. You are welcome to code and follow along, but we certainly don&apos;t expect that you finish every example. Most people find the biggest value in kicking back, observing the live coding session, and uncovering new concepts and ideas, rather than focusing on the mechanics and details of the code and framework. We do more hands-on sessions with all-day/multi-day Cloud Native workshops.
 
 Things that you definitely need on your laptop (Mac, Linux, Windows):

 - JDK8
 - IDE (Eclipse, STS, IntelliJ, Netbeans...)
 - git client
 - mvn (Maven) for command line builds 

Just before the event, you will receive a reminder email containing all the workshop details (date, time and location). In the meantime, if you have any questions related to the workshop, please contact mdougados@pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:mdougados@pivotal.io]]&gt;.
 
 See you soon!
