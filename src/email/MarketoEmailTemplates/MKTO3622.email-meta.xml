 Valued Pivotal Ticket Agents and End-Users, 

 The Global Support Services (GSS) at Pivotal is excited to announce that our Customer Portal is launching 
on April 26, 2016. The new Portal will provide advanced operational excellence to our customers and partners along with many user- friendly features. With the new Portal, we have enhanced Single Sign On (SSO), Support Entitlements, Ticket Management, User Management and Knowledge Base Access. You will also be able to perform the following functions from a single (SSO-enabled) landing page for a more streamlined experience:

 - Access Pivotal Network to download software 
 - Search our improved Knowledge Base for self-help solutions 
 - View &amp; download documentation 
 - Learn about Pivotal&apos;s support offerings &amp; policies



 What happens next? 

 Once the new Portal is launched: 

 - For Pivotal Ticket Agents: continue to sign in Zendesk with your Google authentication through https://discuss.zendesk.com/agent &lt;[[https://discuss.zendesk.com/agent]]&gt; or to access other pages through support.pivotal.io  &lt;[[mailto:support.pivotal.io]]&gt;
 - For Pivotal End-Users: sign in to the new Portal with your existing credentials, follow instructions and set a new password through support.pivotal.io &lt;[[support.pivotal.io]]&gt;
