Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

 Enterprise networks are under constant threat. While perimeter security can help keep some bad actors out, we know from experience that there is no 100%, foolproof way to prevent unwanted intrusions. In many cases, bad actors come from within the enterprise, meaning perimeter security methods are ineffective. 

 Enterprises, therefore, must enhance their cybersecurity efforts to include data science-driven methods for identifying anomalous and potentially nefarious user behavior taking place inside their networks and IT infrastructure. 

 Join &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/big-data/webinar/using-data-science-for-cybersecurity]]&gt; Pivotal’s Anirudh Kondaveeti and Jeff Kelly on January 17, for a webinar on using data science for cybersecurity. You’ll learn how to perform data-science driven anomalous user behavior detection using a two-stage framework, including using principal components analysis to develop user specific behavioral models. Anirudh and Jeff will also share examples of successful real-world cybersecurity efforts and tips for getting started. Webinar details below:
