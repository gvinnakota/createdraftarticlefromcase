    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar Securing Microservices with Spring and PCF &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/jan-29-securing-microservices-spring-and-pivotal-cloud-foundry-webinar?utm_source=promo&amp;utm_medium=webinar&amp;utm_campaign=spring-pcf&amp;utm_term=q119]]&gt;, on January 29, 2019. Microservices offer advantages and disadvantages for security. Microservices can be developed, updated, and scaled separately. However, with more and more microservices to manage, there are numerous doors that intruders can access within an application. While their isolated and standalone structure within applications makes them easier to defend, microservices bring with them their own additional security challenges. In this talk, we&apos;ll walk through a set of Spring-coordinated microservices that are insecure and will integrate them with an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server in order to make them secure. Then we’ll look at the challenges with single sign-on and how Pivotal Cloud Foundry can help to overcome them.
