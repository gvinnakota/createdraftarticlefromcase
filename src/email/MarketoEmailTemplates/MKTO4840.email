<p style="color: #000000; font-weight: normal;" dir="ltr">Colleagues,</p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-weight: normal;">Did you know that Pivotal spends almost $16M annually on food and beverages? This is a big investment for us, and we think we can do a better job for the company and for all of you. We believe that by taking a true Pivotal approach&mdash;learning and iterating&mdash;we can continue to offer the same great experience for our employees and guests, and also save money with the introduction of easy-to-follow guidelines.</p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-weight: normal;" dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-b0dc9f3f-f8b7-8815-48e0-f0ec2533e8f3"><span>Here&rsquo;s the update:</span></span></p>
<ol style="color: #000000; font-weight: normal;">
<li><strong>We&rsquo;ve hired a Global Food Program Manager</strong>. Please welcome Jacob Wilkinson to Pivotal! Jacob started May 1, comes to us from Airbnb, and will be working to improve our offerings with a focus on health, sustainability, and costs. First order of business for Jacob will be to reach out across the company to get feedback on what matters, what&rsquo;s working, and what&rsquo;s not. He will report to Matt Eng on the Real Estate and Brand Experience team.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Seamless</strong>. Starting in mid-May, the concierges (aka, The Happiness Team) in many offices in the US and in our London office will begin a pilot program of the food delivery service Seamless to help us better manage ordering food for approved events and activities. Using Seamless will also provide us with greater insight into our purchasing activity. This ability to measure our purchasing will be of great value as we evolve and improve the program. Please note: For convenience&mdash;and it&rsquo;s optional, employees will also be able to use their personal credit card through Seamless to order personal meals at work. Most of our colleagues in New York already use Seamless and have good things to say about the service. Stay tuned for the company-wide account setup and rollout in late May.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>A Smart and Fair Food Program</strong>. We are not on a mission to slash costs by eliminating our food program. We will continue to serve breakfast every day, serve weekly lunches, and make free snacks and beverages available. We are, however, going to work on developing guidelines for the company sponsorship of food for team meetings, monthly 1:1s, and employee-run social clubs. <strong>Robbie Clutton</strong> (London), <strong>Liz Escobar</strong> (NYC), <strong>Matthew Kocher</strong> (SF), and <strong>Zach Larson</strong> (SF) have agreed to help Jacob, Mike LeBlanc (Finance), and me with this endeavor. We will focus on consistency and fairness, with a goal to publish guidelines this summer.</li>
