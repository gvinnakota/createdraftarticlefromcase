    <subject>Thanks for visiting with Pivotal at AWS re:Invent</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Thank you for taking the time to meet in person with the Pivotal team. We had a very busy show - and we know you did too - so, now that the dust has settled a bit, here are a few of our highlights from the week:


	- We were thrilled to be included in the inaugural group of AWS partners attaining the AWS Container Competency &lt;[[https://aws.amazon.com/containers/partner-solutions/]]&gt;. This competency recognizes those partners that improve AWS customers’ ability to run workloads using containers on AWS.
	- Pivotal &amp; AWS were together on the CUBE talking about our relationship and what we see next in the partnership. Watch it here &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5msotNvobE8]]&gt;.



Whether you’re brand new to Pivotal or have been part of our community for a long time, below are several great resources to help you do more Pivotal and AWS:


	- Quick Start &lt;[[https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/pivotal-cloud-foundry/]]&gt;: This is a reference deployment built by Pivotal and AWS. This is a one quick installation of Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) on AWS.
	- Service Broker &lt;[[https://github.com/awslabs/aws-servicebroker/blob/master/docs/getting-started-pcf.md]]&gt;: This new Service Broker provides organizations with PCF on AWS access to 18 different AWS services (with more on the way!).



More information about the Pivotal and AWS relationship can be found here &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/partners/aws?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=global-event-aws-reinvent-las-vegas-q418]]&gt; and for more Pivotal specific content, please explore these sessions &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ezNJvajUU0&amp;list=PLAdzTan_eSPQsR_aqYBQxpYTEQZnjhTN6]]&gt; from our annual conference, SpringOne Platform.

Thank you,
