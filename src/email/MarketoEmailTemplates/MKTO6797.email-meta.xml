    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

We invite you to fill out the Built to Adapt Benchmark questionnaire &lt;[[https://benchmark.builttoadapt.io/overall]]&gt; to measure your organization’s software 
development performance. When you complete the Benchmark survey, you get a customized result that you can share with members of your team, which can unlock conversations around how to be more software-driven. 

Pivotal collaborated with the analyst firms Longitude Research and Ovum to assess the world’s top organizations. This Benchmark study is a quantitative framework of indicators that gauges how well an organization builds, deploys, and operates software. With more than 1,600 respondents across six countries and five industries, the research explores how organizations align their product development and IT operations with business goals to build software.

If your team is tired of fighting fires, answering texts on weekends, manually patching, and fighting for budget, this can be a great tool to get going in the right direction. Go to the questionnaire now &lt;[[https://benchmark.builttoadapt.io/overall]]&gt; and see how your organization stacks up! 

Thank you,
The Pivotal Team
