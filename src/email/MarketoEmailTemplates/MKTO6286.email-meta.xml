SpringOne Platform is around the corner and so many cool things are in the works. We’ll be sending you updates periodically to keep you posted on activities, talks and more. We’re excited to see you there, and hope you are too!
Submit Your Lightning Talk 

Do you have something you’ve wanted to share with your peers, but a 40 minute talk was just too long? Do you think cats hold magical abilities and feel the community needs to know? Then lightning talks &lt;[[https://springoneplatform.io/2018/lightning-talks]]&gt; are your chance to showcase your passions, tech knowledge, anything you feel would be compelling, to a lively audience.
You have five minutes to present. Build 20 slides that auto-advance every 15 seconds. Captivate us with your exposition. And that’s it. Please fill out the form &lt;[[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fWeVtFArAeRhlV4Tb5JCZDqboMy1TVPaqJ16vdkDxEk/viewform?edit_requested=true]]&gt; by Friday, August 17 (it’s short and sweet, we promise).
We look forward to seeing you in Washington, D.C. this September. Stay tuned for more updates!
