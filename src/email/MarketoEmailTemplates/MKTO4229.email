<p dir="ltr"><span>Team,</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">By the numbers, SpringOne Platform 2016 was an unconditional success: 2,000 attendees; nearly 600 from target accounts; 34 leaders at the CIO Summit; 9 analysts at our first Analyst Day; and more than 75 partners at Partner Day.
 We accelerated deals, added entirely new opportunities, and introduced Pivotal to more influencers.<br /><br />Most importantly, we helped enterprise and industry technologists learn incredibly powerful ways to transform how they build software.<br /><br />It was our customers and the open source community who validated our "better together" story of Spring and Cloud Foundry.
 Global industry shapers&mdash;including Liberty Mutual, Comcast, Allstate, Manulife, Bloomberg, Merrill, Gap, Schwab, The Home Depot, Humana, Cardinal Health, McKesson&mdash;took the stage and one by one, explained how our technology and practices have fundamentally changed their companies.
 Spring Boot is bringing microservices deep into the enterprise, while Cloud Foundry extends that digital transformation as a "bet the business" play for our customers.<br /><br />Some 97% of attendees said that they'd like&nbsp;to attend this event again in 2017, and we're definitely ready to give the people what they want.
 As Rob Mee announced in yesterday's Town Hall, we're hosting SpringOne Platform 2017 in the software epicenter of San Francisco, from December 4 &ndash; 7 at Moscone West.<br /><br />Just like this year's conference, SpringOne Platform 2017 will bring together Pivots, developers, operators, executives, analysts, and partners in one place to learn from the best.
 Attendees provided a ton of feedback on what they loved and what we could do better, so we have every intention to deliver an even bigger and better conference in 2017 (gaming included!).</p>
