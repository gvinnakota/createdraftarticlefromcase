    <subject>1/11/18 Webinar:  Secrets of Successful Digital Transformers</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar, Secrets of Successful Digital Transformers &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/jan-11-secrets-of-successful-digital-transformers-webinar?utm_source=brighttalk&amp;utm_medium=digest&amp;utm_campaign=siblings-pcf-q118]]&gt;, on January 11, 2018. 

Call it Younger Sibling Syndrome: You study the successes and failures of those who came before. You replicate the wins. You limit the failures. You capitalize on the experience of pioneers and trailblazers. 

Digital transformation is no different. Over half of the Fortune 500 is already using Cloud Foundry® as part of their digital transformation strategy. Where have they succeeded? How can you replicate? What will you need? 

Wherever you are on your digital transformation journey, learn from your predecessors. In this talk, Dormain Drewitz distills the experiences of Fortune 500 companies using Cloud Foundry. Attend this session to learn more about the patterns around strategies, processes, and team-level tactics.
