Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 

Thank you for attending our webinar on Domain Driven Design (DDD) and Reactive Programming. 

 Vaughn Vernon gave us some valuable insights on how a good domain model can reduce complexity and avoid having your application become a ‘big ball of mud’. He also discussed how bounded contexts are a good approach to designing microservices. Wes Williams showed us how an in-memory data grid like Pivotal’s GemFire can be used for implementing microservices and communicating across bounded contexts using the principles of Reactive Programming. 

 The webinar recording is now available &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/agile/webinar/domain-driven-design-and-reactive-programming]]&gt; for on-demand access. Please feel free to pass this information onto any of your interested colleagues..
