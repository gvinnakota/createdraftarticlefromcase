    <subject>12/5 Webinar - Why Hybrid Cloud Demands Consistency</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for Why Hybrid Cloud Demands Consistency &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/dec-5-why-hybrid-cloud-demands-consistency-webinar?utm_source=promo&amp;utm_medium=webinar&amp;utm_campaign=hybrid-cloud-forrester&amp;utm_term=q418]]&gt;, on December 5, 2018. 

Companies have realized that hybrid cloud adoption approaches better meet their needs for various reasons including increased developer velocity, improved infrastructure efficiency, and 
high availability/stability. 

But to take advantage of all hybrid cloud has to offer, companies must leverage consistent platforms, services, and tools across their hybrid cloud “continuum” to build and deploy new apps, modernize existing apps, and drive up infrastructure efficiency. Business stakeholders, development teams, and IT teams will benefit from a hybrid cloud approach that offers consistent services, tools, security, and operations wherever they choose to build, modernize, or deploy applications. 

Join Pivotal’s John Allwright, with special guests Thomas Squeo of West Corp and Dave Bartoletti of Forrester, for a discussion about the benefits of hybrid and multi-cloud approaches, and best practices for realizing their full benefit. 

Presenters: 
Thomas Squeo, CTO, West Corp
Dave Bartoletti, VP, Forrester
John 
Allwright, Director of Product, Pivotal

Date: Wednesday, December 5, 2018
