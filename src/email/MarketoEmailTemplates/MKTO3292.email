<p><strong><br />SALES: Positioning Our Team for a Big Year<br /></strong></p>
<p>In the Americas, <span class="c2">we have elevated <strong><em>Andrew Ettinger</em></strong><span class="c2">&nbsp;to lead four geographic and industry-focused regions in the United  States: Telco/Media led by  <strong><em>Craig  Nowell</em></strong><span class="c2">;<span 
class="c2">&nbsp;Financial led by <strong><em>Bill Serino</em></strong><span class="c2">;<span class="c2">&nbsp;<span class="c2">Southeast<span class="c2">&nbsp;U.S.
                              led by <strong><em>Brian</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;Froehling</em></strong><span class="c2">;<span class="c2">&nbsp;and a new Mid&ndash;South U.S.
                              region led by <strong><em>Mat Wilcox</em></strong><span class="c2">.
                              <strong><em>Andy O'Brien</em></strong><span class="c2">&nbsp;will continue to lead our biggest geography, which encompasses Northeast U.S./Canada led by <strong><em>John Jahnke</em></strong><span class="c2">, Central/Western U.S.
                              led by <strong><em>Rob Schmitt</em></strong><span class="c2">, U.S.
                              Government led by <strong><em>Keith Salisbury</em></strong><span class="c2">, Industrial led by <strong><em>Steve Kutscher</em></strong><span class="c2">, <span class="c2">and Latin America led by <strong><em>Ana Claudia 
</em></strong><strong><em>Borges</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong><span class="c2">&nbsp;We will now have a powerful duo in Andy and Andrew to drive a significant portion of our company's business.
                              Special thanks to Andy for his ongoing leadership and teamwork with Andrew to position Pivotal for a big year.<br /><br /></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>In Europe, building  
on       their      2015             progress,  <strong><em>Alan Coad</em></strong><span class="c2">&nbsp;will  continue to tighten the EMEA focus on the most important markets, sectors and accounts.
                              Our 2016 plan is to drive scale with foundational wins in each targeted market&mdash;setting us up for rapid expansion across the region.
                              Following some coverage changes this year, Alan&rsquo;s sales regions and leaders are UK/Ireland led by <strong><em>Robbie Byrne</em></strong><span class="c2">, <span class="c2">Germany, Switzerland, Austria &amp; Netherlands<span class="c2">&nbsp;(DACH/NL)<span 
class="c2">&nbsp;led    by             <strong><em>Michael Ramsperger</em></strong><span class="c2">, France &amp; Southern Europe led by <strong><em>Stephane Dubois</em></strong><span class="c2">, and Middle East led by <strong><em>Rached Dabboussi</em></strong><span class="c2">.
                              We have already opened new Pivotal offices locations in Dublin and Berlin in 2015.
                              We will shortly move into a much larger space in London and have Paris on the horizon for 2016.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br />In Asia, we mentioned <strong><em>Melissa Ries</em></strong><span class="c2">&nbsp;is            moving   
into   a     new      role in Corporate   Development focused on strategic partnerships.
                              As we continue our search for a new APJ Leader during the interim, the country leaders will report directly to Bill Cook.
                              In addition, each country/region will have a Pivotal executive sponsor: Scott Yara (Japan&ndash;<span class="c2 c4"><strong>Takumi Masai-san</strong><span class="c2">), Leo Spiegel (Korea&ndash;<span class="c2 c4"><strong>YoungSoo &ldquo;Scott&rdquo; Lee</strong><span 
class="c2">),        Edward        Hieatt (South Asia&ndash;<span class="c2   c4"><strong>Waiyuen &ldquo;Eric&rdquo; Sin</strong><span class="c2">), James Watters (China&ndash;<span class="c2 c4"><strong>Patrick Liu</strong><span class="c2">), Bill Cook (Australia&ndash;<span class="c2             
 c4"><strong>Gavin        Jones</strong><span class="c2">).
                              Similar to Europe, we opened new Pivotal office locations in Sydney and Tokyo in 2015, and have Beijing on the horizon in 2016.
                              These investments will accelerate growth in Asia, and we expect to expand our Asia footprint with major customer wins in 2016.<br /><br /></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><strong><em>Alex Luttschyn</em></strong><span 
class="c2">&nbsp;will          continue    to  lead Labs sales, and <strong><em>Tim Kalbas</em></strong><span class="c2">&nbsp;will continue lead our Data sales efforts.
                              Both Alex and Tim will be primarily focused on our Americas business, but will provide support for the respective Labs and Data sales teams in the other geographic regions.<br /><br /></span></span><strong><em>Lan Haarmann</em></strong><span class="c2">&nbsp;will now  
   serve    as       Chief    of       Staff    to  both Bill Cook and James Watters, helping Bill and James work even closer together on sales strategy.<br /><br /></span>Finally,<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><span class="c2">over<span class="c2">&nbsp;the last two years, <strong><em>Michelle   
           Kerr</em></strong><span class="c2">&nbsp;has    given  extraordinary service to Pivotal between her leadership and contributions in marketing and    sales.
                              While she explores new opportunities within Pivotal and the Federation, Michelle will continue reporting directly to Bill Cook in a new executive advisory role.<br /></span></span></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>SERVICES: Fostering a Renewal Culture</strong></p>
<p>In   mid&ndash;2015 we introduced the newly formed Customer Success Organization (CSO), which now includes the entire technical field of pre- and post-sale technologists, who act as one team to help our clients adopt and  become successful with our products and            services.
                              The CSO group is directed at the core of our company mission to transform how the world builds software&mdash;if customers renew their Pivotal Cloud Foundry or Big Data Suite subscription, it validates that our software is transforming their companies for the better.
                              Renewals keeps customer &ldquo;churn&rdquo; low, and has quickly become one of our most critical areas of focus as we continue our journey to hyper-growth.<br /><br />We have made significant progress in how the CSO group will align, communicate and operate in 2016.
                              Among the most important developments is the concept of a &ldquo;Consumption Plan&rdquo; for each of our customers, which outlines how a customer will use our products and services.
                              This document, created at the time of sale and with the input of our sales team, the CSO team, and the customer, helps to quickly align all the players.
                              It then becomes the basis for us to measure, over time, if a customer is on track for renewal.
                              This will be the most important indicator&mdash;along with a consistent approach to measuring Customer Satisfaction&mdash;for future renewals across our customer portfolio.<br /><br />In order to foster better communication between our various account-focused teams, 
we      have        introduced the   concept of standups and retrospectives.
                              These practices have been so successful at Labs over the years because of their emphasis on continuous alignment and feedback among teams.
                              They will help to align and build a unified culture in the field, and help our teams succeed in their mission to help clients transform over time.<br /><br />Finally, we have made further organizational changes, listed below,<span class="c2">&nbsp;to define our CSO    
   structure      more              consistently   across the globe.
                              One important note is that we have renamed the pre-sales&nbsp;role known as PCF Field Engineer role (FE) to &ldquo;Platform Architect&rdquo;.<br /><br /></span>Leadership for CSO globally remains constant:</p>

<p><strong>LABS: Alignment and Growth</strong></p>
<p>Pivotal Labs continues to be led by <strong><em>Drew McManus</em></strong><span class="c2">, with regional leadership from&nbsp;<strong><em>David Goudreau</em></strong><span class="c2">&nbsp;(US <span class="c2">West<span class="c2">),    <strong><em>Rahul            Singh</em></strong><span 
class="c2">&nbsp;(US East), and <strong><em>Josh Knowles</em></strong><span class="c2">&nbsp;(EMEA).
                              In 2015, Labs truly aligned with the PCF business&mdash;close to half of <span class="c2">Labs projects<span class="c2">&nbsp;now include the use of PCF, and that percentage will continue to grow.
                              Further, over half of Labs projects now use Spring technologies.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br />The Labs and PCF joint-selling motion and the importance of           each to the other for our customers is well ingrained, and Labs is 
         now     operational in 16 cities  and stands at over 500 Pivots strong.
                              We&rsquo;re extremely proud of the Labs team for making a dramatic shift in focus in just two years.
                              Time and time again <span class="c2">we<span class="c2">&nbsp;hear from our customers that they find Labs to be exactly what they are looking for during this time of disruption and change in industry.
                              This represents a way of building software that is both disciplined and effective, and also fosters innovation, catalyzes change, and brings a relentless focus on the customer experience.
                              Labs now serves dozens of these companies daily on what for them has become a critical journey.<br /><br /></span></span>2016 will be another year of growth for Labs, both in terms of the number of Pivots and the number of offices.
                              We expect to open offices in at least four more cities, and to add more than 150 new Pivots over the year.
                              In conjunction with the Labs and PCF offering, <strong><em>Siobhan McFeeney</em></strong><span class="c2">&rsquo;s <span class="c2">Transformation<span class="c2">&nbsp;team provides us with a way to help companies as they lay out their plans for organizational change 
  to         support       their       goals    of     working differently.
                              We have found that the transformation offering is a powerful means to enable all products and services as we work with very large clients such as Ford, Home Depot, and Allstate.<br /><br /></span></span></span>Through <span class="c2">Labs and our Transformation team, 
  we         present           customers       <span class="c2">both <span class="c2">a vision and the well honed tactics that come from more than two decades of direct experience in helping companies change.
                              We&rsquo;re excited to continue to grow the presence of these offerings globally in 2016!<br /></span></span></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>ENGINEERING: Transforming How The World Builds Software</strong></p>
<p>2016 is shaping up to be a big year for product innovation at Pivotal&mdash;Cloud   and Data.<br /><br />In Pivotal Cloud Foundry, the bets we've made over the past two years are paying off.
                              Diego, our next-generation container orchestrator and runtime, is now in production both on PWS and in PCF.
                              Substantial improvements to BOSH are close to shipping, and will open up new opportunities for deploying and managing robust data services for our customers.
                              And our efforts around application <span class="c2">log and metrics visualization<span class="c2">, analysis, and monitoring will be making their way to customers soon.</span></span><br /><br />We are in a great position to iterate rapidly, and continue to deliver the 
    industry's    most   comprehensive cloud native platform.<br /><br />Spring has also had a banner year.
                              In 2015, Spring Cloud Services entered g<span class="c2">eneral availability<span class="c2">, and we have brought a powerful microservices stack to our PCF customers' fingertips.
                              And monthly downloads for Spring Boot, which unlocks the potential for rapid application development, have more than doubled over the past year&mdash;<span class="c2">hitting <span class="c2">2.25 million monthly downloads.<br /><br /></span></span></span></span>The   
fact      that         Pivotal    is         responsible for both PCF <span class="c2">and<span class="c2">&nbsp;Spring gives us a substantial competitive advantage in the market.
                              We now have a unique opportunity to bring these two powerful technologies closer together, and to ensure that PCF is the premier platform for running Spring microservices.<br /><br /></span></span>These organizational changes give us an opportunity to enable the       
ever-growing     PCF              engineering,    PCF product, and Spring teams to collaborate more closely and efficiently.
                              Under the broader <span class="c2">Cloud R&amp;D organization<span class="c2">&nbsp;headed by <strong><em>Onsi Fakhouri</em></strong><span class="c2">,<span class="c2">&nbsp;<strong><em>J</em></strong><strong><em>ames B</em></strong><strong><em>ayer 
</em></strong><span class="c2">will          continue    to  oversee product for PCF<span class="c2">,<span class="c2">&nbsp;and <strong><em>Ryan Morgan </em></strong><span class="c2">will continue to oversee Spring and App Fabric.<br /><br 
/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>We&rsquo;re also                 excited to welcome    <span class="c2">CloudCredo <span class="c2">into <span class="c2">the <span class="c2">Pivotal Cloud R&amp;D family.
                              The CloudCredo team are Pivots at their core<span class="c2">.
                              T<span class="c2">hey&rsquo;ve built their business <span class="c2">upon <span class="c2">and operate <span class="c2">it <span class="c2">using the Pivotal approach<span class="c2">, <span class="c2">and <span class="c2">they <span class="c2">bring a wealth of     
experience     and           expertise        around     helping customers deploy and iterate on top of Cloud Foundry.
                              In particular, CloudCredo CEO <strong><em>Colin Humphreys</em></strong><span class="c2">&nbsp;<span class="c2">has been a remarkably skilled, visionary, and empathic communicator of the power and versatility of the Cloud Foundry platform.
                              In light of his skills and experience, we&rsquo;re excited to announce that Colin will be joining us as CTO for Cloud<span class="c2">.<span class="c2">&nbsp;As CTO, Colin will help us articulate and communicate our big picture strategy and roadmap as we deepen our    
     investments    in     our       cloud         offerings.<br /><br /></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>In Pivotal Big Data, we had <span class="c2">a great year and overachieved on our most important    
     metric&mdash;Big  Data    Suite     bookings      growth.
                              In less than two years, we have transformed our business to be ~80% subscription based.
                              Given our transition to <span class="c2">o<span class="c2">pen <span class="c2">s<span class="c2">ource for all data products over that same time period, we've aligned our data business with market forces and trends in ways that few thought were    possible.<br /><br 
/></span></span></span></span></span>And while our 2015 financial results give us much to be proud of, there&rsquo;s still a lot of hard engineering work <span class="c2">ahead around <span class="c2">unifying our Data tools with our Cloud Platform in order to unlock the promise of our open source 
                             vision for big data.
                              As a result, we <span class="c2">are <span class="c2">elevating <strong><em>Elisabeth Hendrickson</em></strong><span class="c2"> with broader responsibilities<span class="c2">.
                              Elisabeth <span class="c2">will now lead R&amp;D for all Data products<span class="c2">, and <strong><em>Duncan Lord </em></strong><span class="c2">and the Data Product Management teams will report directly to Elisabeth.<br /><br 
/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>Finally, we want to thank you all for <span class="c2">your effort<span class="c2">s<span class="c2"> and contributions.
                              As Rob mentioned, being agile in how we organize ourselves is the right thing, but change that affects people requires empathy, understanding, patience, and support.
                              We will take these steps with confidence, knowing that they better position us for another record-breaking year.<br /><br /></span></span></span>Bill, Scott, Edward, James<span class="c2">,<span class="c2">&nbsp;and Onsi</span></span></p>
