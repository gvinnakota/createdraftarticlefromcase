    <subject>Date Change for SpringOne Tour London</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

We look forward to seeing you at SpringOne Tour London in June. We wanted to give you notice that due to the popularity of the event, moved to a larger space.In order to accommodate this change, we had to push the dates to later in the week.

Please note that SpringOne Tour London will now be on June 21-22. If this is an issue and you can no longer attend, please email springonetour@pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:springonetour@pivotal.io]]&gt; and we will process a refund for you. Also, if this means your colleagues and friends can now attend, please invite them to register here &lt;[[http://springonetour.io/2018/london]]&gt; as well.


Let us know if you have any other questions and thanks for being flexible!
 
Sincerely, 
The SpringOne Tour Team
