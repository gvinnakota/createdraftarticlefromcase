    <subject>New Fiscal Year Calendar</subject>
    <textOnly>Colleagues,
Beginning February 4, 2017, Pivotal will transition from our current Calendar Year (CY), which ends on December 31, to a new Fiscal Year (FY) based on a 4–4–5 model. Converting to this new FY will synchronize our financial reporting, business processes, and sales cycles with Dell Technologies&apos; Fiscal Year, and will help us maintain operational efficiencies.
Our current year follows the calendar, running from January 1 to December 31, with four quarters of three months each. Pivotal’s new 4–4–5 FY will also have four quarters, but each quarter will consist of one four-week period, a second four-week period, and a final five-week period.
On February 4, 2017, the FY2018 will begin, and will be structured as follows:



 - Q1 FY2018: February 4 – May 5, 2017 


 - Period 1: (4 Weeks) February 4 – March 3, 2017
 - Period 2: (4 Weeks) March 4 – March 31, 2017
 - Period 3: (5 Weeks) April 1 – May 5, 2017




 - 
Q2 FY2018: May 6 – August 4, 2017


 - 
Q3 FY2018: August 5 – November 3, 2017


 - 
Q4 FY2018: November 4, 2017 – February 2, 2018



This will not change how Pivotal operates as an independent company, and it is business as usual with our customers. I encourage you to review the 4–4–5 FAQ  &lt;[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/180lEOnpzULa9G6inX5qfM5_ZdX_kCsqr8-SQXa9-40g/edit]]&gt;to understand the specifics on what our new fiscal year will look like, the changes and benefits that will come with this new calendar, and how we have prepared for this.
