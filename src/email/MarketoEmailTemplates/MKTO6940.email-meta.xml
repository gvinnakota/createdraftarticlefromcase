Hello, I’m David Krant. Here is your bi-weekly dose of 5 Point Friday, a Pivotal Pulse designed to gather sales strategies, customer stories, talk tracks and valuable data points to help you uplevel customer conversations.

As a member of the Dell Tech Alliances team, my goal is to help you stay informed and armed with the best available information that you can share with your customers and prospects.

Our team is here for you, so if you have ideas, requests, questions or suggestions please reach out. Happy Selling!

 


 



 


 


1. How do I find pivotal opportunities?

I speak with many sellers who know Pivotal is an exciting part of the Dell Tech family but need help identifying what a good lead looks like…Here is how I like to think about it:
If your customer or prospect is considering:



	- Building their own software applications 



	- PAS - Pivotal Application Service (The artist formerly known as PCF)


	- Cloud Native / DevOps methodologies 



	- Pivotal Labs


	- Containers / Microservices 



	- PKS - Pivotal Container Services (The ‘K’ tips the hat to Kubernetes)


	- Data platform for rapid analytics on petabyte scale data volumes



	- GPDB - Greenplum Database


	- Replatforming legacy applications



	- App Modernization / App Replatforming Services





Forget how to contact Pivotal for deal support? Pivotal.io/dell-survey &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/dell-survey]]&gt;


 


 



 


 


2. Dell Tech - ‘Drinking Our Own Champagne’ 


Did you know Dell EMC is one of Pivotal’s largest customers?  Bask Iyer, EVP/CIO at Dell Digital and his team are hyper-focused on digital transformation and ‘coding like a startup’.  In fact, there is a Pivotal Lab dedicated to Dell EMC IT in Round Rock 2 East. We are still ramping up from our current 10 full-time Pivots, and we have 60+ Dell resources engaged with us in changing the Dell development culture!  All of these efforts are supported by a PCF platform that is managing nearly 3,000 application instances.

3. Got Data? think greenplum!
 
Big Data, AI, ML continue to be hot topics in our everyday lives. Why GPDB? Here is the value prop:

Multi-Cloud Deployment - Public, Private, and Fully Managed Cloud configurations and newly added on-prem options
Integrated Analytics - New Analytics like ML, GeoSpatial, Graph, Text and others run on the same environment as traditional BI &amp; reporting
Continuous Innovation - 100% committed to PostgreSQL innovation, fully 
re-architected to support future PostgreSQL releases

And the best news...we’ve been working closely with Dell EMC, and have a new Greenplum Solution ID:



	- Based on Dell’s robust line of PowerEdge Servers

	- Enterprise-class components - no exotic or custom hardware

	- Flexible, proven, data-centric hardware building blocks

	- Built from identical, proven components (memory, CPU, disks, interconnect, controllers)

4. Industry News - Pivotal Named Microsoft Consumption Partner of the Year 
 
For the 2nd year in a row, Pivotal has received Microsoft’s &quot;Consumption Partner of the Year&quot; award for the US. This award is based on the total annual contract value of registered PAS and Pivotal services which have landed on Azure during MSFT&apos;s 2018 fiscal year.

Why should you care? Because your customers are getting in the Digital Transformation / Agile App Dev game and they need great technology partners to be successful. Does Dell EMC have a solution for customers that love Microsoft Azure? Absolutely! Enter the Dell EMC Azure Stack solution which has been tested and validated to run Pivotal Cloud Foundry

5. Pivotal ready architecture 
 
Yes - we can’t shut up about PRA. Why? Because ~70% of Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) is being deployed On-Prem and PRA is absolutely the best place to land PCF. Why do Pivotal Sellers care? Because the fastest path to Developer productivity, apps in production and platform consumption is job #1 and the definition of success.

Did you know that PRA delivers 30%+ lower infrastructure TCO over 5 years?
Don’t take my word for it...check out the white paper from Edison Group &lt;[[https://www.dellemc.com/resources/en-us/asset/analyst-reports/products/converged-infrastructure/edison-roup-vxrail-tco-study.pdf]]&gt;.




Happy selling!
