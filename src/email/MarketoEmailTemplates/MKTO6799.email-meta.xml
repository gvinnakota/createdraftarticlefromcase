    <subject>Pivotal Welcomes Slice of Lime</subject>
    <textOnly>Team,

I’m excited today to announce that Denver-based Slice of Lime joins our Pivotal Labs design practice. With its singular focus on user experience design for web and mobile applications, Slice of Lime has become a top-ranked design agency, garnering a number of local and global awards, including being named UX 
Magazine’s “Most Effective UX Agency”.

I’m delighted to welcome founding partner and CEO Kevin Menzie, partner and Creative Director Jeff Rodanski, and the entire talented 
Slice of Lime team to Pivotal. Kevin has made a career of leading strategy and creative for successful startups and agencies. He founded Slice of Lime in 2001, and has spent the past 15 years there focused on building its award-winning culture and outstanding teams, and developing the business. Jeff has been with Slice of Lime since the beginning. He built a career leading the creative for a series of successful startups, and as Art Director for the Boulder Marketing Agency, where he worked on a variety of enterprise accounts.

With its mantra 
to “create amazing experiences,” Slice of Lime has attracted a diverse roster of local and national clients. They bring the same agile principles that define Pivotal’s development culture: teams pair, align UX design to software development cycles, and put clients and their end users at the center of the product experience—from discovery and framing right through the completion of a project. 

With their passion for learning, teaching, and collaboration, Slice of Lime and their team of 18 is a welcome addition to Pivotal. That Slice of Lime is very excited to join us is testament to the caliber of the Pivotal design practice. Kevin will become the Office Director for our team in Boulder, while Jeff will become an Associate Director in the Denver office. The Slice of Lime teams will work on wide range of local and national clients. 

I recently sat down with Slice of Lime’s Kevin Menzie to talk about his team’s culture, and their approach to the user experience, which we captured in this blog post &lt;[[https://blog.pivotal.io/?p=35635]]&gt;.  

Once again, I’m delighted to welcome the Slice of Lime team to Denver and to Pivotal!
