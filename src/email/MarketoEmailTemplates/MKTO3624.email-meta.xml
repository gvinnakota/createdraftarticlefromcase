    <subject>Your NEW Customer Portal is coming soon, providing complete access with SSO</subject>
    <textOnly>Valued Pivotal Customers and Partners,



The Global Support Services team at Pivotal (GSS) is excited to share the news that our Customer Portal is coming soon, with a targeted launch at the end of April 2016. The new portal will provide advanced operational excellence to our customers and partners along with many user-friendly features. With the new Customer Portal, we have enhanced Single Sign On (SSO), Support Entitlements, Ticket Management, User Management and Knowledge Base Access. You will also be able to perform the following functions from a single (SSO-enabled) landing page for a more streamlined experience:


	- Access Pivotal Network to download software
	- Search our improved Knowledge Base for self-help solutions
	- View &amp; download documentation
	- Learn about Pivotal&apos;s support offerings &amp; policies



What happens next?

From now through the end of April 2016, continue to sign in to the existing portal with your credentials through support.pivotal.io &lt;[[mailto:support.pivotal.io]]&gt;. Prior to the launch date, we will send you a follow-up email with the exact launch date, a list of FAQs, and an instructional video providing a quick tour of the new Customer Portal. This second email will also include detailed instructions for signing in or creating a new account with us.



Have questions about your new Customer Portal?

If you would like any further information or to opt out from this list, please email us at customer-service@pivotal.io &lt;[[Mailto:customer-service@pivotal.io]]&gt; or call us at +1 877.477.2269 &lt;[[tel:18774772269]]&gt;.



Sincerely,



Your Pivotal GSS Team</textOnly>
