 AGENDA &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/event/digital-transformation-forum/london]]&gt; 

Getting to Reception
Scaffolding obscures sightlines to The Warehouse from the Old Street Roundabout, but if you persevere through the building site, youâ€™ll find us!

Step-by-Step Directions

 - Come out of Subway 4 from Old Street Tube Station
 - Walk up the ramp on your left
 - Immediately in front of you there is white boarding with &quot;Ceviche&quot; and &quot;Maki&quot; advertised, walk past this to the right into a mini courtyard
 - The revolving doors for our building are immediately on your left
 - Enter the building, walk down to your right past the coffee shop and you will find the elevators at the end; we are on the 2nd floor

Change in plans?
