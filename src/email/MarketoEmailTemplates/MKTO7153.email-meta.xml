    <subject>Pivotal 5-Point Friday</subject>
    <textOnly>February 01, 2019

Hello, I’m Kalvan Swanky, a proud member of the Dell Tech collective for 16 years, spending time at EMC, Dell EMC, Virtustream, Dell EMC again, and now Pivotal as part of the new Dell Synergy Sales Team covering the West! I work with the joint SAB teams driving digital transformation opportunities with a focus on PKS and Pivotal Ready Architecture adoption for our joint customers. I hope you enjoy this issue of 5 Point Friday.

 


 



 


 

1. .NET legacy apps = Huge Opportunity

Every other sales call I go on, the customer outlines a huge amount of existing .NET applications that provide business critical services and are revenue generating. Customers are desperate to replatform/refactor these applications to the ‘cloud’ to get new efficiencies and unlock new functionality. They can’t do it themselves, but we can help! Application Transformation (AppTX) is a fantastic Pivotal service (service brief here &lt;[[http://home.mv.treehousei.com/MVImages/Pivotal/Service-Brief-App-Transformation-Services.pdf]]&gt;) where we partner with the customer to modernize their software quickly. To learn more about modernizing .NET Apps, check out this free eBook &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/ebooks/modernizing-net-applications]]&gt;.

2. Pivotal &amp; Microsoft Apps are like peanut butter &amp; chocolate!


Microsoft has pivoted quickly to compete against Amazon AWS. Microsoft also sees a huge opportunity to move millions of old .Net apps to the cloud (to Azure they hope). We have been aligning with, and partnering with Microsoft around this joint opportunity. Pivotal is now part of the .Net Foundation &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/blog/you-re-investing-in-net-and-so-are-we-pivotal-is-now-a-corporate-sponsor-of-the-net-foundation]]&gt;! Another great .Net centric project to be aware of is Steeltoe. Steeltoe is an OpenSource project &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/platform/services-marketplace/microservices-management/steeltoe]]&gt; headed up by Pivotal that seeks to provide the fantastic Netflix OSS and Spring Cloud toolsets to .Net developers. And needless to say, our PCF PAS 2.4 release is a fantastic place to automate and run your .Net apps.

 


 



 


 


3. Why Digital Transformation means middleware modernization


This is a great blog post by Rohit Kelapure &amp; Joel Thimsen, two really smart guys. They lay out how complex all the ‘stuff’ is that helps run the actual app on the server. Their presentation &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/slides/why-your-digital-transformation-strategy-demands-middleware-modernization]]&gt; really lays out well why we have a huge, expensive legacy issue, and how Pivotal’s automation solutions (PCF) can help solve it. It’s a mouthful, but you will be glad you learned it!
