    <subject>More Kubernetes love from Pivotal and VMware in the Channel</subject>
    <textOnly>March29, 2019

Hi!! My name’s Fabio Chiodini. I joined Pivotal in July 2018 as a Platform Architect on the Dell Tech Synergy Team supporting the EMEA region. Before that I’ve been in the DellEMC family for many years curating the Dell Technologies messaging, training our field in the gentle art of Cloud-Native architectures and helping out in the Alliances organization. IMHO to win together we must enable each other and be passionate about our Awesome tech. ;)


 


 



 


 

1. Kubernetes is not just for geeks


Kubernetes is top of mind for geeks like me but getting a different perspective may help you in opening more doors for PKS: in this report &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/intersect/the-cios-guide-to-kubernetes]]&gt; after getting a Cx level overview of Kubernetes you’ll be able to 
understand why it matters now and how it compares/relates to containers, PaaS, serverless, microservices and Big data.
A MUST read to get all the facts around Kubernetes (and incidentally sell more PKS ;)). If you are talking with CIOs I suggest You to sign up to Pivotal Intersect &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/intersect]]&gt; and get all the latest on the future of enterprise IT.

The CIO&apos;s guide to Kubernetes &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/intersect/the-cios-guide-to-kubernetes]]&gt;

2. Pivotal and VMware PKS GTM for Partners


Pivotal Container service (PKS) is firing on all cylinders with new customers coming in every week. VMware and Pivotal are now opening up opportunities for VMware partners in this space by launching a new competency track.
VMware Enterprise PKS competency &lt;[[https://blogs.vmware.com/partner/2019/02/vmware-pks-solution-competency-now-available.html]]&gt; enables 
partners to:



	- Identify/unlock container opportunities to grow revenue and margin by creating &amp; expanding customers virtualization infrastructure for VMware Enterprise PKS.
	- Extend service delivery offerings by building practices around helping customers package and deploy existing apps leveraging Kubernetes containers through VMware Enterprise PKS.
	- Differentiate from the competition, solidifying trusted advisor status with their customers.



To be able to play in this space get ready to have your teams Sales and Presales/Delivery resource complete the PKS VSP &lt;[[https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.vmware.com_partners.html-3Fapex_PRMPartnerUnivTab-3FstURLmLa-3Dhttps-3A__mylearn.vmware.com_mgrReg_plan.cfm-3Fplan-253D111826-2526ui-253Dsso&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=lnl9vOaLMzsy2niBC8-h_K-7QJuNJEsFrzdndhuJ3Sw&amp;r=BKIawXz5ytN6eJaJmWlUclk4FNN2ZW73G-khjoApRd0&amp;m=MenMXM9_EvWUZo3zqWDn6tHQbPLs5xXN2C94RjQIbX0&amp;s=iLSsmykXMoLzakiS_-UgtYOPcvVHVIrAoEYA16ze2Lk&amp;e=]]&gt; and VTSP &lt;[[https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.vmware.com_partners.html-3Fapex_PRMPartnerUnivTab-3FstURLmLa-3Dhttps-3A__mylearn.vmware.com_mgrReg_plan.cfm-3Fplan-253D111829-2526ui-253Dsso&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=lnl9vOaLMzsy2niBC8-h_K-7QJuNJEsFrzdndhuJ3Sw&amp;r=BKIawXz5ytN6eJaJmWlUclk4FNN2ZW73G-khjoApRd0&amp;m=MenMXM9_EvWUZo3zqWDn6tHQbPLs5xXN2C94RjQIbX0&amp;s=BcqzRE1HIJ4Lbz_mnq__7IQU_pnW6Ir4RcDlwYMzy3A&amp;e=]]&gt; today!
These great courses showcase the value of PKS and are open to DellEMC as well.



 


 



 


 


3. Serverless: getting it right with Pivotal


In every customer meeting I get the question: “What are you doing in the serverless space?”. If you’re like me and want to be prepared, take a look at a great session &lt;[[https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/17382/347166/developing-serverless-applications-on-kubernetes-with-knative]]&gt; my good friends Bryan Friedman and Brian McClain recorded on how to use Pivotal technologies to 
deploy serverless workloads.
If you fancy reading books (like myself!) from the very same authors you can get your own copy of their most recent book on serverless &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/ebooks/getting-started-with-knative]]&gt;:

4. PKS Enterprise Demos for VMware Admins

Seeing is believing: no matter how passionate you are about PKS and how good you are at presenting it, nothing beats a demo. And a demo of PKS Enterprise on VMware is the best!!
To make PKS easier for the average VMware admin, I started a video series &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT1zSnR1i6dz9RVMfFUfhk6MtFPCuKuRs]]&gt;: explaining the basic functionalities of Pivotal Container Service (PKS). 
My goal is to have very short demos that showcase PKS functionalities in an easy way: Kubernetes simplified by PKS, Self healing K8s clusters, Storage integration, Fixing Kubernetes vulnerabilities, NSX-T integration, containers monitoring and MORE!!
You can reuse these demos to showcase PKS in front of your Customers or you can just send the 
link to your prospects to answer technical questions or ramp excitement around our offering.
Alternatively, to show a live demo, I have prepared a walk-through &lt;[[http://home.mv.treehousei.com/MVImages/Pivotal/DellTech/PKS-Simple-Demo-on-VMware-HoL.pdf]]&gt; that you can use 
by leveraging the VMware hands on lab &lt;[[https://labs.hol.vmware.com/HOL/catalogs]]&gt; PKS (HOL-1931-01-CNA) setup.
