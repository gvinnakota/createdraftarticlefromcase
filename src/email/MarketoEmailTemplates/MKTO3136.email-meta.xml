The latest release of Pivotal Cloud Foundry® &lt;http://pivotal.io/platform?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=pcf-16-announcement&gt; brings together the key principles of modern Cloud Native software development into a turnkey platform and brings you frameworks for the latest architectural styles.

Integrated Microservices with Spring Cloud Services
