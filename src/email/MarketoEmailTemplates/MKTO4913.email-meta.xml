    <textOnly>A Java Dev Learns to Go with Matt Stine
Join us Thursday evening, April 24, 2014, at the Denver, CO Pivotal office for a meetup with Matt Stine (http://bit.ly/POSH0033)

Schedule:
5:30-6:30 pm Pizza and networking  
6:30-8:00 pm Talk and Q&amp;A  
8:00-8:30 pm Wind down 

The Cloud Foundry engineering teams have steadily increased their use of the Go programming language (http://golang.org &lt;http://golang.org&gt;) for building (or rebuilding) components, starting with the Router, and progressing through Loggregator, the &quot;cf&quot; CLI, and more recently the Health Manager 9000.

As a Java-developer-turned-DevOps-junkie focused on helping our customers and community succeed with Cloud Foundry, it&apos;s become clear to me that I need to add Go to my knowledge portfolio.

Go is a very interesting language, open-sourced by Google in late-2009, that takes a &quot;less is more&quot; (http://commandcenter.blogspot.de/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html &lt;http://commandcenter.blogspot.de/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html&gt;) approach to language design, but that also bakes in a powerful concurrency model.

This talk will introduce Go, delve into its distinctives, and contrast its approach with that of Java (where appropriate). We&apos;ll also write a fair amount of Go code along the way. This talk will be of particular interest to Java developers looking to add Go to their toolkits, but will also be of interest to anyone looking to learn a little bit more about Go.

Matt Stine is a Cloud Foundry Platform Engineer at Pivotal. He is a 13 year veteran of the enterprise IT industry, with experience spanning numerous business domains.

Matt is obsessed with the idea that enterprise IT “doesn’t have to suck,” and spends much of his time thinking about lean/agile software development methodologies, DevOps, architectural principles/patterns/practices, and programming paradigms, in an attempt to find the perfect storm of techniques that will allow corporate IT departments to not only function like startup companies, but also create software that delights users while maintaining a high degree of conceptual integrity. He currently specializes in helping customers achieve success with Platform as a Service (PaaS) using Cloud Foundry and BOSH.

Matt has spoken at conferences ranging from JavaOne to CodeMash, is a regular speaker on the &quot;No Fluff Just Stuff tour, and serves as Technical Editor of &quot;NFJS the Magazine. Matt is also the founder and past president of the Memphis/Mid-South Java User Group.</textOnly>
