<p dir="ltr">Team,</p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-858afe0f-cc95-f8e4-647a-7f5036939f80"> </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Last week we had our 2017 kick-off for the global field. As Rob noted earlier this month, we closed 2016 on a high note: We reached our sales goals and had a stellar year for Pivotal Cloud Foundry, achieved newsworthy industry wins, and meaningfully expanded our relationship with many of our existing customers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We also learned important lessons: A successful customer journey to becoming a modern software company means refactoring both monoliths and organizations; transformation is done in stages; and when Pivotal acts in concert as one team, we are peerless in helping customers on their ambitious journeys. These lessons are the building blocks for 2017 in our aim to transform how the world builds software.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We've just made the kickoff videos available on <a style="color: #059a91; text-decoration: none;" href="https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/inside-pivotal/corporate-marketing/corporate-communications/2017-global-field-kick-off-videos">Inside Pivotal</a>, so please take time to view them and gain a perspective on the template for 2017. The big takeaways from last week are:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Bring more new customers on board. This includes leading with what makes us unique&mdash;our culture of teaching others how to teach their teams to fish. We have ambitious Labs-led win goals in Q1 to continue our tremendous momentum.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Expand and grow the annual contract value (ACV) of Pivotal Cloud Foundry with existing customers. Without getting into financial minutiae, this means, in a broad sense, expanding our footprint with existing customers. In a software subscription business like ours&mdash;where we deliver software and realize revenues over time or annually&mdash;we gain and add value as customers move more of their core applications into production on our cloud platform.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Have Engagement Plans drawn up and applied to every customer. Pivotal is different from other enterprise software companies&mdash;where we aim to give customers what they need at the right point in time on their journey. These engagement plans help Pivotal and our customers map a course against their top business outcomes, where every touchpoint with Pivotal has impact and fosters trust.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Help customers migrate applications away from monoliths to cloud-native architectures. This goes back to building our staying power with customers, and Services has a big role in fostering customer trust by helping them succeed with our technology.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I've never seen more optimism from our leadership team and across the company at the start of a new year. The goals and expectations we have are once again higher, but if we follow this template, and work as one, we will continue on our trajectory. We have a Town Hall coming soon where we will elaborate on these and other themes, so stay tuned. In the meantime, enjoy the videos, reach out to your managers with questions, and here's to an awesome 2017!</span></p>
