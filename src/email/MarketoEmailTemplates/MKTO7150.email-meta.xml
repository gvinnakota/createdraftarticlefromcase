    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar 6 Things You Need to Know to Safely Run Kubernetes &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/apr-11-6-things-you-need-to-know-to-safely-run-kubernetes-webinar?utm_source=promo&amp;utm_medium=webinar&amp;utm_campaign=6-thing-kubernetes&amp;utm_term=q119]]&gt;, on April 11, 2019. 

Kubernetes has exploded in popularity among developers. But as operations teams prepare to support Kubernetes in production, they have more considerations—namely, how to operate a stable platform while maintaining security and compliance. How Kubernetes is configured and deployed has a marked impact on these attributes. 

Attend this session with Author and Pivotal Vice President of Technology, Cornelia Davis, to learn the following:


	- 
How to isolate tenants in your Kubernetes environment.

	- 
How to make upgrading Kubernetes clusters boring.

	- 
What you should—and shouldn’t—let your developers do.

	- 
What you need around your Kubernetes clusters to keep them safe.

	- 
How using Pivotal Container Service (PKS) helps run Kubernetes.
