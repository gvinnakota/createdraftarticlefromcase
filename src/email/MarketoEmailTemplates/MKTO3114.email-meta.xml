    <subject>Learn About Apache HAWQ (incubating) - The Advanced Hadoop-Native SQL Database</subject>
    <textOnly>Thursday, November 19, 2015
JOIN HERE &lt;https://pivotalcommunity.adobeconnect.com/hawqnest/&gt;
Join us here &lt;https://pivotalcommunity.adobeconnect.com/hawqnest/&gt; for the first official virtual meetup of the Apache HAWQ (incubating) community this Nov 19. No registration is necessary. To receive reminders of this event, please subscribe to the Apache HAWQ user email list &lt;mailto:user-subscribe@hawq.incubator.apache.org&gt;.


Apache HAWQ (incubating) is a massively parallel processing, Hadoop-native SQL analytics database that operatives directly in HDFS. As a hybrid of an MPP database and Hadoop, it inherits key features from both parties. It is highly SQL compliant, extremely fast and scalable. Unlike other SQL engines on Hadoop, it is fully transactional.


In this talk, Dr. Lei Chang provides an overview on HAWQ architecture and opportunities for contributions and collaboration with the Apache community. He will also introduce a simple pathway for contributors to bring their innovative ideas for the HAWQ kernel.
