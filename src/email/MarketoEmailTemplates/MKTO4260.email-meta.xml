Hello,
 
For Molina Healthcare, operational efficiency is a must. The Long Beach, California-based company provides Medicare and Medicaid health plans to customers in numerous states. “In the Medicaid environment, we don’t have ability to raise prices or raise premiums,” says Molina CEO Dr. Mario Molina &lt;[[http://www.beckersasc.com/asc-coding-billing-and-collections/molina-healthcare-is-the-aca-s-latest-success-story-6-things-to-know.html]]&gt;. “We have to learn to live within a budget.” To stay on plan, Molina must run its IT environment as efficiently as possible.
 
In this webinar &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/big-data/webinar/drive-operational-it-efficiency-with-hadoop-native-sql-analytics]]&gt;, learn how Molina Healthcare uses Pivotal HDB, the leading Hadoop native SQL database, to analyze machine-generated data from servers, databases and applications to ensure its data centers are running at peak efficiency.
