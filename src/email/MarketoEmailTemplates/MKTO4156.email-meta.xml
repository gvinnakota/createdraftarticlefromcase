    <subject>9/27 Webinar - Introducing the Cloud Foundry Java Client 2.0</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/introducing-the-cloud-foundry-java-client-gmt]]&gt;
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there,}} 

 Pivotal is committed to setting the standard for Cloud Native Java. The addition of the Java Client extends that leadership, allowing programmatic interaction with Cloud Foundry&apos;s REST APIs. This fully reactive API makes automating Cloud Foundry operations in Java / Spring as straightforward as possible.
 
Project leads Ben Hale and Paul Harris will introduce the project components, the Client API and Operations API, which offer their reactive implementation courtesy of http://projectreactor.io/ &lt;[[http://projectreactor.io/]]&gt;. Cloud Foundry developers and architects should expect code samples, demonstration, and a practitioner-focused presentation from the leaders of this community effort, which we&apos;re pleased to say extends far outside of Pivotal. 

 Date: Tuesday, September 27 
Time: 7:00 AM PDT / 2:00 PM GMT / 3:00 PM CET
 
Secure Your Spot &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/introducing-the-cloud-foundry-java-client-gmt]]&gt;

 We look forward to you joining us!
