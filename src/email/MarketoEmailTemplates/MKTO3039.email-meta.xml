    <subject>Thank You for Joining Pivotal at AWS re:Invent 2015</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

Thanks for visiting the Pivotal booth at AWS re:Invent &lt;http://reinvent.awsevents.com/&gt; 
last week in Las Vegas. We hope you enjoyed learning about Pivotal’s Cloud Native journey &lt;http://pivotal.io/cloud-native-workshop&gt;, and how we can help you build modern apps on the most popular open source cloud platform. If you haven’t seen what you can do with Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Spring, check out what our customers have to say for themselves:


 - Humana &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T4p5vA2cSM&gt; partnered with Pivotal to transform their business and adopt cloud native frameworks on Pivotal Cloud Foundry, providing the optimal environment to develop cutting edge mobile applications and digital products.

 - CoreLogic  &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdI51QlO7TU&gt;uses Pivotal Cloud Foundry to deliver high quality products and services faster than ever before while freeing up developers to focus on core 
products.

 - CenturyLink &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y970krM-XSk&gt; provides communications and data services to residential, business, governmental and wholesale customers in 36 states that leverage the cost 
savings and scalability benefits of a high-performance public cloud with the customizability of Pivotal Cloud Foundry.
 - EMC/Documentum &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhSlHQyMRv0&gt; rebuilt their most popular SaaS based content management system on Pivotal Cloud Foundry using microservices and cloud native architectures so developers could concentrate on what&apos;s most important to them instead of wasting time on infrastructure plumbing.
