    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 
 
Thanks for joining Pivotal at GOTO Chicago. We hope you enjoyed learning how enterprises are adopting cloud-native application architectures to drive modern, software experiences for their customers. If you’d like to talk to us about arranging a hands on workshop day in your offices or at a nearby hotel, simply inquire here &lt;[[http://pivotal.io/cloud-native-workshop?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=global-event-goto-chicago-q218]]&gt; to begin a discussion. 
 
Need some dev/test or CI environments? Try running Spring Boot on our public Cloud Foundry instance, Pivotal Web Services &lt;[[http://run.pivotal.io/spring]]&gt;, a platform engineered for Spring Boot. 
 
In the meantime, start your Cloud-Native Journey &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/cloud-native?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=global-event-goto-chicago-q218]]&gt; and learn about underlying concepts &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/topics?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=global-event-goto-chicago-q218]]&gt;, why it matters, what it looks like and how to become cloud-native.
