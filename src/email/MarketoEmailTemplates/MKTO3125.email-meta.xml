    <textOnly>Over two and half years ago we started on the journey to help transform traditional enterprises into modern software companies. At the same time we transformed ourselves from selling Data Warehousing appliances and Application Servers to agile software development, open cloud native platform and open source big data technology.

We’ve come a long way. There’s been a lot of hard work, challenges, complexities, strategic milestones and fun!

At its heart, the thing that makes Pivotal a great company are the people. It starts at the top. Paul, Rob, Bill, Scott and Leo are visionary, humble and transparent. They roll up their sleeves, do what’s right and are a pleasure to work for. These things matter and are hard to find. I feel privileged to be working with them and each and every one of you. We have a great team and I would like to thank-you for your passion and hard work.

We are on a fast moving train where the engine and carriages are being changed without slowing down. 2015 has been a very challenging year for me as I have been juggling the need to take care of my family in Australia who have been undergoing significant health issues, with the need to be traveling in the region. I want the best for Pivotal and the best for myself and my family so have decided to step aside from the Pivotal APJ Leadership role and will be relocating back to Australia to take a Corporate Development role reporting to Leo.

I am very grateful to you and to the 
Pivotal leadership team for the opportunity to build the team and the business, it has been an amazing experience and far exceeded my expectations when I joined EMC back in 2009. I will continue to lead the APJ team until the new person comes on board with full focus on closing out the year.

Thank you for all your support, lets make Q4 the best quarter ever!
