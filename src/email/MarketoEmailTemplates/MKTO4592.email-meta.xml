    <textOnly>All,
A year ago, Rob defined Pivotal’s community as one that “starts with employees, but also includes our customers and a diaspora of alumni &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/blog/pivots-are-what-set-pivotal-apart]]&gt;.” Moreover, Pivots embrace a unique, disciplined, and opinionated point of view on software development—which we share with our clients and partners as honorary Pivots.
As we see more and more enterprises having adopted The Pivotal Way, it’s reminiscent of our time at Twitter—where Twitter engineers that we were collaborating with started listing the fact that they worked with Pivotal Labs on their resumes and LinkedIn profiles. Moreover, this practice continues with our biggest clients stating their proficiency with our next-generation development methodology, as well as cutting-edge technology.
Today, we officially launched the #ImAPivot program &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/blog/imapivot-a-community-for-the-world-s-leading-software-experts]]&gt; to give our community a forum to share their transformation stories.
Our first wave of stories features Citi &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/imapivot/citi]]&gt;, HelloGbye &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/imapivot/hellogbye]]&gt;, and charity: water &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/imapivot/charity-water]]&gt;—showing the meaningful impact we’re having on organizations across the spectrum.
After talking to our enterprise customers on their preferred platform, we have decided to start our community efforts with the #ImAPivot LinkedIn group, which allows our clients to publicly identify themselves as honorary Pivots committed to changing the fortunes of their company for the better. However, we need all of you to join the community and reach out to your former and current clients and extend an invitation—send them this link &lt;[[https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7063370/profile]]&gt;.
Enjoy these stories and share them with others.
