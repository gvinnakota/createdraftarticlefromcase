    <subject>2/21/19 Webinar - Developing Serverless Applications on Kubernetes with Knative</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 

Please join us for the webinar Developing Serverless Applications on Kubernetes with Knative &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/feb-21-developing-serverless-applications-on-kubernetes-with-knative-webinar?utm_source=promo&amp;utm_medium=webinar&amp;utm_campaign=kubernetes-knative&amp;utm_term=q119]]&gt;, on February 21, 2019. 

Serverless computing has become a hot topic in developer communities. The use of ephemeral containers eliminates the need for always-on infrastructure. But the real payoff for serverless is greater code simplicity and developer efficiency. Sounds great! Except the open-source serverless framework space is crowded and complex. Each unique offering approaches functions differently, with varying methods for triggering, scaling, and event formatting. How is that efficient? 

One thing that most everybody can agree on is to build on top of Kubernetes. With that as the only common ground though, there is still too much fragmentation for developers to wade through when deciding on the right open source serverless solution. 

That&apos;s where Knative comes in. An open-source project from Google, Pivotal, and other industry leaders, Knative provides a set of common tooling on top of Kubernetes to help developers build serverless applications. It extends Kubernetes by combining Istio with Custom Resource Definitions to enable a higher-level of abstraction for developers. This brings support for source-to-container builds, autoscaling, routing, and event sourcing. Join this session with Brian McClain and Bryan Friedman to see a complete working demo of Knative and learn:


	- 
What are the components of Knative and how do they work together 

	- 
What are the different ways to deploy serverless applications and functions on Knative

	- 
How and when to use Knative’s build features, such as Buildpacks

	- 
What is Knative’s eventing model and how are event sources used to trigger functions

	- 
How Project riff compliments development on top of Knative
