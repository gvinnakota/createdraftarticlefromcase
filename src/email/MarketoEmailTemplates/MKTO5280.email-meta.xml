    <subject>Updates to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy</subject>
    <textOnly>It’s part of Pivotal’s cultural ethos to always look for new ways to continuously improve Pivotal’s 
software products—to ensure you have the best platforms and tools to rapidly develop and run applications. You’ve probably noticed that Pivotal is adding a lot of new features to its flagship software products, and growing very quickly. To support these developments, we’ve made a few updates to our website Terms of Service &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/terms-of-use]]&gt; and Privacy Policy &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/privacy-policy]]&gt;, as well 
as our terms of use agreements for Pivotal Academy &lt;[[https://pivotal.io/training/terms]]&gt;, Pivotal Postfacto &lt;[[https://postfacto.io/terms]]&gt;, PivNet &lt;[[https://network.pivotal.io/terms_of_use]]&gt; and Pivotal Partner Portal &lt;[[https://partners.pivotal.io]]&gt;, effective November 1, 2017. 

We always want to be transparent with you about how our products work, and how changes may impact you. We hope this has been helpful, and welcome your feedback and questions &lt;[[mailto:privacy@pivotal.io]]&gt;. Most importantly, thank you for your continued support of Pivotal, as we build platforms and tools to help you transform how the world builds software.


Thank you,
The Pivotal Team
