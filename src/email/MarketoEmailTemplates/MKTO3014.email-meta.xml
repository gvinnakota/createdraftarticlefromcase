    <textOnly>Pivotal Managers,

The following is an important legal notice regarding Communication Guidelines and FAQs &lt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AKzHacE-wC1d2TM3AquT1-rd97qJ1heyYXrP3xEoK_Q/edit&gt; relating to the EMC/Dell transaction that was announced today. Please review them carefully, follow them, and use them to assist you with your internal/external communications.

At Pivotal, we remain focused on our own mission. However, because certain Pivotal communications could be attributed to EMC, we need to adhere to these Guidelines.

Thank you and regards, 
Andy</textOnly>
