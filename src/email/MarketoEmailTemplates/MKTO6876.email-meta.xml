Accelerating Development



 
 
 
 



In November, our editorial focus was on Accelerating Development. Faster developer feedback cycles result in more effective digital products.

 
 

At Pivotal, we champion several ways of accelerating development. Test driven development, continuous integration of code, and the use of microservices and containers are all critical to build and maintain momentum when developing software. Below are three examples of how partners and customers are moving fast to deliver success.

Q&amp;A with Colin Stevenson

This month we spoke with Colin Stevenson, who leads our Platform Architect team working with partners.




1. What do you like most about being a partner platform architect at Pivotal?





Every day is a different day! When I joined Pivotal, I first worked with a few global system integrators, several of whom have turned into key strategic partners. Over time, I branched out into working with large public cloud provider partners. This provided me with an exciting new experience to engage in a joint product approach in addition to a services focus. 






2. What are the most commons questions and concerns you hear from partners when you start new engagements and how do you answer them?






When new partners approach Pivotal, many think of Pivotal Labs or Pivotal Tracker, or they may be familiar with our spin-out from EMC and VMware. Most are not familiar with the evolution we&apos;ve gone through over the last five years.

A common question from system integrators is, &quot;How do we learn Pivotal Cloud Foundry?&quot; Of course, that&apos;s a loaded question - what do you want to do with PCF? Do you want to run PCF? Do you want to deploy applications to PCF? Both?

Once partners understand what PCF does, the next question is, &quot;How do you differentiate from the competition?&quot; I try to break down how PCF stands out from the competition in several ways:



	- Hybrid and multi-cloud capabilities provide a consistent abstraction across all clouds for our customers to run their applications free from restriction.
	- A rich ISV ecosystem allows customers to run their software on BOSH or PKS in ways that bring the same multi-cloud capabilities to their software similar to PCF.
	- A proven approach to security with our 3 R&apos;s: Rotate credentials automatically, repave the platform with zero downtime, and repair security fixes fast through Pivotal Network. 



There&apos;s a lot under the covers with each of these and I&apos;m happy to spend the time with our partners so that they understand how these work.

Finally, I point to the many customer testimonials and positive business outcomes we&apos;re driving together. I encourage our partners to be a part of this success with us. I believe together we can make an impact for our customers by providing a great platform to build better software.






3. What one piece of advice would you share with partners that will help them build successful Pivotal practices?






Just one? Commit, but be flexible. We can start small together. Getting that first win is critical to deliver value for a customer. That doesn&apos;t happen without commitment. Commitment to learn, not just technology, but people and process, together. While we go on this journey, things will change. If we remain focused on our customers we can evolve, build great software, run that software, and grow!</textOnly>
