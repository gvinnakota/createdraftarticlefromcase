Welcome to Pivotal! &lt;#new-pivots&gt;
EDITOR WELCOME
 Anti-Fragile 
 Steve Casale &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/1033819-stephencasale&gt;, Sr. Manager, Corporate Communications
Challenge comes in many stripes, but new companies all share common pressures of managing everything from runaway success, to market shifts, to scaling out. Pivotal is no stranger to these pressures. Teams were formed sometimes overnight, bringing with them long lines of expertise and cultures in open source, data, and Agile development.
 
 Putting a vision to its test is a crucible. The stories in this issue underscore how from that crucible we’re adapting and growing – rather than throwing up walls against change. Russell Acton’s vibrant EMEA update shows that a “Total Pivotal” sells, while Ian Manter’s article highlights how one team’s anarchic early days helped forge a team. We zoom in on Boulder to see how Agile continues to be the spark for customer changes.
 
 As we adapt, and become comfortable with and thrive under uncertainty, we’re showing how to lead the way to next. Hats off to all of you who continue to make that happen – it ain’t easy.
BUSINESS UPDATE
 EMEA Field – Bringing Customers “Total Pivotal” 
 Russell Acton &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/922302-russellacton&gt;, VP, EMEA Field Operations
Our industry in EMEA is moving faster than I can remember at any time. A glance back at the second half of 2014 shows us making progress across many fronts. This week marks a year since the UK-based team moved to London &lt;http://www.itproportal.com/2013/12/06/pivotal-opens-new-london-office-begins-100m-investment-in-tech-city/&gt;, and the Field team has expanded to meet new 
market demands.
 
 Our vision resonates as strongly as ever with customers and, as we demonstrate PaaS leadership, we’re seeing a steady increase in Pivotal CF &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/pivotal-cf&gt; (PCF) revenues. It’s particularly pleasing to see joint Pivotal CF and Pivotal Labs opportunities dominate our pipeline, as companies want to build great software products and sustain that through a newfound agility. Fidelity, a global finance company, placed its second Pivotal Labs order in EMEA – along with a nice $1M-plus Pivotal CF deal. We already do Data and Apps business with them. They are truly living the Pivotal dream!
 
 Customers Calling
 We’re seeing traction around that theme of “Total Pivotal”. Fast on the heels of Fidelity, comes a middle-eastern security agency. Following an EBC in July, we closed a $1M+ Pivotal Greenplum Database &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/big-data/pivotal-greenplum-database&gt; deal with this client, and they more recently placed their first Pivotal CF order. Shout out to Dekel Tankel: We did a San Francisco EBC together where Dekel helped plant the seeds of Pivotal CF. With Siemens also placing Pivotal CF, Pivotal Big Data Suite &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/big-data/pivotal-big-data-suite&gt; (BDS) and Pivotal Labs orders, keep an eye for other deals of this nature – it’s becoming a 
trend!
 
 We know how compelling the Pivotal Big Data Suite package is, and Audi thinks so too. With our partners Capgemini and EMC, we created the first European, “Data-Driven User Experience Center” in Germany. The centre features Pivotal Big Data Suite and Pivotal CF heavily, of which Audi hopes to become the first user. Willis, a multinational insurance company, agrees with Audi. They tested our capabilities to the limit, led by Michael Natusch &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/938104-michaelnatusch&gt; and his merry band of data scientists, especially Ian Huston &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/919508-ianhuston&gt;. Ian did a great job showing Willis how to optimize parts of their risk business – specifically flood models in Australia. That machine-learning prowess helped pull in a Pivotal Big Data Suite deal, a great win that came down to the skills of our Data Science team.
 
 I’ve seen James Watters &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/920258-jameswatters&gt; in his hoodie, so I know we are cool. But some of the coolest people also know it. Bono (of U2 fame) was at Europe’s hottest tech event, Web Summit &lt;http://websummit.net/?source=ADWg&amp;gclid=CIuB_8ih9cACFRFcfgodZCcArg&gt;, and Pivotal had a big week in Dublin. In addition to Edward Hieatt’s keynote &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal/features/humana-and-pivotal-show-web-summit-the-secret-to-faster-more-predictable-software-development&gt;, we logged over 300 conversations at our 
booth, hosted a customer dinner with numerous prospects (including a delegation from the service provider Orange), conducted press briefings, and hosted executive breakfasts and dinners.
 
 Crowding the Platform
 No, we’re not talking about Europe’s 
aging, overworked rail system. The Pivotal Cloud Platform Roadshow &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/cloud-platform-roadshow&gt; rolled into Europe in Q3, with over 350 registrations and sell-out sessions across four countries. These deep dives on Pivotal CF also proved to be a great occasion and knowledge exchange for the EMEA Field itself.
 
 It’s easy to get carried away with highlights, but a lot of effort and heroics often goes into making these good news stories. From Professional Services &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/groups/80786-pivotalprofessionalservices&gt; to Global Support Services to the rest of the team, I’d like to thank everyone on the front lines and those 
who help them “Make it Happen”.  I’m proud of the focus and commitment we’ve all had in a year of change and growth.
 
 Now we get back to business to meet Q4 and FY14 targets. With a focus on growing a healthy pipeline, we’re also ready to shift into higher gear around Pivotal CF and Pivotal Big Data Suite in FY15. Stay tuned!
PRODUCT UPDATE
 Mobile Services for Pivotal CF Ramps Up
 Nithin Rao &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/973295-nithinrao&gt;, Director, Mobile Product
Since our launch in August &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/pivotal-further-defines-enterprise-paas-with-introduction-of-pivotal-cf-mobile-services&gt;, Pivotal CF Mobile Services (Push Notifications &lt;http://docs.pivotal.io/mobile/notifications/index.html&gt;, API Gateway &lt;http://docs.pivotal.io/mobile/api-gateway/index.html&gt;, Data Sync &lt;http://docs.pivotal.io/mobile/datasync/index.html&gt;) are already making a big impact with customers. Mobile use cases can tie the full breadth of Pivotal offerings into an integrated and unique solution for customers.
 
 Take our recent win with a major sports brand as an example. They’re not only utilizing Pivotal CF Mobile Services &lt;http://docs.pivotal.io/mobile/notifications/mobile-home.html&gt;, but also app development services from Pivotal Labs, Pivotal HD &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/big-data/pivotal-hd&gt;, HAWQ, Spring &lt;http://www.pivotal.io/products/spring&gt; and (of course) Pivotal CF as the platform which brings it all together.
 
 This started as a Pivotal Labs engagement to create a cutting-edge mobile app for multiple platforms, including iOS. It didn’t take long for the customer to realize that they also needed a dedicated and robust push notifications solution. Further, Pivotal CF allowed the customer to instantly scale up to handle tens of millions of users while enabling zero-downtime upgrades in production using blue-green  &lt;http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/blue-green.html&gt;deployments &lt;http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/blue-green.html&gt;.
 
 Finally, they’re utilizing the Pivotal Big Data Suite and Spring to ingest in-app video 
viewing data and generate analytics – gaining in minutes insights that used to take days. In short, the integration of Pivotal technology and services enabled the rapid development, streamlined operation and data-driven optimization of a world-class mobile solution.
 
 We’re just getting started. We have an exciting product pipeline that includes comprehensive mobile analytics and Internet of Things &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things&gt; (IoT) services. We’re also working closely with the Pivotal CF team to build API security and governance functionality right into the platform.
 
 We’re here to ensure that Pivotal CF is the definitive software development platform for a mobile-first world. Try out Pivotal CF Mobile Services, and let us know what you think!
AGILE UPDATE
 Bold in Boulder – Changing Development One Customer at a Time
 Kevin Olsen &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/984322-kevinolsen&gt;, Director Pivotal Labs Boulder
The story through 2014 for Pivotal Labs in Boulder &lt;https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/document/d/1t5gTbaqx4PFLIUirYc6-HqYrWC1XLQl3_DyLIJ_v9MM/edit&gt; has been one of consistency. We’re building a base of enterprise customers by helping them change how they do business through great applications and learn the ways of Agile development. Here’s an overview of some of our successful engagements in 2014.
 
 Pearson Education &lt;http://www.pearsoned.com/&gt; was a major account in the first half, where we successfully shipped Passport, a set of 
authorization and content management services that support Pearson’s new back-to-school platform Revel &lt;http://www.pearsonhighered.com/revel/&gt;.
 
 Medtronic &lt;http://www.medtronic.com/&gt; is the world’s largest medical technology company. We delivered the HTML5 client for their Stealth Connect &lt;http://www.medtronic.com/for-healthcare-professionals/products-therapies/neurological/surgical-navigation-and-imaging/neurosurgery-imaging-and-surgical-navigation/systems-software-instruments/#tab1&gt; surgical planning software, allowing surgeons to work collaboratively to plan procedures through advanced imaging technologies. This was a highly successful engagement that resulted in Medtronic pulling us into other discussions on how we can contribute to their next generation “S8” surgical navigation solutions.
 
 Savoya &lt;http://savoya.com/&gt;, a Dallas startup that coordinates and delivers ground transportation in 60 countries, is shaping up to be a great model in how we can help startups bootstrap an engineering culture. We’re helping them hire and train a in-house engineering team and rebuild their ten-year-old, offshore codebase into a modern, Angular.js/Ruby on Rails web application.
 
 We’ve also had the opportunity to work with local non-profits like Center for Resource Conservation &lt;http://conservationcenter.org/water-home/slow-the-flow-colorado/&gt;. They engaged us to modernize their water-auditing program with a mobile web app for their field auditors and a web-application to support municipalities and homeowners throughout audit season.
 
 Finally, Boulder is also home to a permanent Cloud Foundry team that has been helping 
deliver Pivotal CF’s Loggregator &lt;https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator&gt;, Jarvice and now Diego &lt;http://blog.pivotal.io/cloud-foundry-pivotal/features/cf-summit-video-diego-reimagines-the-cloud-foundry-elastic-runtime&gt;.
 
 In 2014, we&apos;ve built clear momentum around the core principles of great software and transformational engagements. We expect to continue helping clients meet the challenge of delivering great software – and a great software culture – from here in Boulder, Colorado.
PEOPLE UPDATE
 From the Crucible – One Team’s Story
 Ian Manter &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/917574-ianmanter&gt;, Business Analyst, Sales Operations
The Pivotal Business Field Operations &lt;https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/users/917574-ianmanter/organization&gt; team was born overnight over 18 months ago, when individuals from Greenplum (EMC) and vFabric (VMware) came 
together to support the Field. Our new presence meant addressing whatever required attention: Quotes, deal reviews, contracts, bookings and forecasts, deal analysis, customer support, policy, Salesforce.com implementation, to name just a few.
 
 Along with being unfamiliar with each other’s expectations we had 
the challenge of managing two systems. So, it’s easy to see how the first eight months was akin to fighting a fire, but instead of hoses, we had to resort to squirt guns while the equipment was on order. With little time to sort through various expectations and talents, we had to discover them along the way.
 
 Fast-forward 12 months. We now support close to 121 sales representatives – up from 85. We’ve formulated a strategy around necessity, distributed vital workflows (such as customer support services) to other functions, and have built vital ties to functions such as Finance, and Legal.
 
 We’ve gone from ad-hoc and sometimes inconsistent levels of service, to 
building core competencies focused on creating value for the Field. We pulled each other up, and that bred trust among the team. We earned the right to joke around with each other, and we know what kind of person will succeed on this team.
 
 
 Hard at Play: Sales Field 
Ops and friends wind it down after softball.
 
 As Greg Stroud outlined &lt;http://play.gopivotal.com/index.php/email/emailWebview?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRoku6rPZKXonjHpfsX94%2BwtUKGwlMI%2F0ER3fOvrPUfGjI4DSMFlI%2BSLDwEYGJlv6SgFTLLAMal10LgNWxg%3D&gt; in his Business Update more than a year ago, making sales teams successful is why we exist – and we’ve covered new tools and Field enablement, expanded Salesforce.com functionality, and streamlined policies and processes to speed up sales, from 
proposal through bookings.
 
 In many ways though, the hard work has just begun, and we continue to change and grow. Today we turn things around more than twice as fast, we know our roles, and we’re ready for the big ambitions of next year. So yes, we will Make it Happen!

I help my husband on our homestead and organic farm, where we grow all varieties of vegetables, berries and fruit – including apple, plum, cherry and fig. My husband will find the statement &quot;in my spare time&quot; amusing as I have had little spare time this year and that’s not just an excuse to get out of farm work! I find great satisfaction and contentment splitting firewood or pushing a plow and working the earth. My farm is my solace.
 
 
 This Good Earth: On the farm with Cindy Lee
I spent about two years traveling the globe, mostly in third-world countries, on the back seat of a tandem bicycle. We were the first tandem bike to reach the North Face of Mount Everest base camp in Tibet. I was a lot younger and fitter then!
is an opportunity to do something great with friends I have known and worked with for 25 years. Equally important has been the opportunity to meet and work with amazingly talented, inspired and authentic people that I hope will be friends for the next 25 years.
