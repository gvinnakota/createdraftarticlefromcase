Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},
 
We invite you to download our new white paper: Secure, Hybrid FinServ Reference Architectures for Cloud-Native Applications &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/white-papers/secure-hybrid-banking-reference-architectures-for-cloud-native-applications?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=q2-2017-WP]]&gt; authored by Pivotalâ€™s Jared Ruckle, Matt Stine, Ford Donald, and Guillermo Tantachuco.
 
Running IT for a financial institution is not for the faint of heart. The job requires a unique mix of creativity, agility, pragmatism, and plenty of grit. There are constant generational changes to navigate, like:



 - 

Rising consumer expectations. The market now expects your apps to behave like their favorite mobile apps. You need to deliver fast, responsive, and engaging experiences to be relevant.


 - 

Increased competition from FinTech. Your competitors aren&apos;t only your neighbors on Wall Street. Silicon Valley&apos;s best and brightest aim to disrupt the financial services industry.


 - 

Regulatory requirements &amp; compliance. Industry rules and regulations must inform how you innovate and where you invest.


 - 

Security. The most successful financial services institutions of the next decade will go fast and go secure. Choosing one or the other isn&apos;t an option.



How can you capitalize on these seismic shifts and gain market share? By becoming a cloud-native enterprise.
