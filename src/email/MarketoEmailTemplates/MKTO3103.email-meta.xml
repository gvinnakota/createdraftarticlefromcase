    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=There}},

We’re sorry you were unable to join us yesterday. Coté tackled the first installment, The Greenfield Journey &lt;http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/ensuring-cloud-native-success-the-greenfield-journey&gt;, of our 3 part Cloud Native Journey series. During Ensuring Cloud Native Success: The Greenfield Journey, we reviewed the top goals and strategies that can help companies and teams deploy greenfield projects:

 - Earn trust by showing success
 - Establish a continuous delivery pipeline and cloud platform
 - Learn by doing and educate the rest of the organization

Check out the replay &lt;http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/ensuring-cloud-native-success-the-greenfield-journey&gt; and slides &lt;http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/ensuring-cloud-native-success-the-greenfield-journey-54828545&gt; and don&apos;t forget to register to join Coté and
