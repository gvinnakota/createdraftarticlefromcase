The ability to deliver software is no longer a differentiator. In fact, it&apos;s a basic requirement for survival. Companies that embrace cloud-native patterns of software delivery will survive, and companies that do not embrace them will not.
 
Register now &lt;http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/the-cloud-native-journey-with-simon-elisha&gt; for this informative webinar where we will:


 - Look at the common patterns that distinguish cloud native companies and the architectures that they employ.
 - Discover that an opinionated platform, one that stretches from the infrastructure all the way to the application framework, rather than ad-hoc automation, is an essential component to an enterprise&apos;s cloud native journey.
 - Show that the combination of Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Spring is the complete cloud native platform.


Join us &lt;http://pivotal.io/platform/webinar/the-cloud-native-journey-with-simon-elisha&gt; to hear from Simon Elisha, CTO &amp; Director of Field Engineering and learn more!
