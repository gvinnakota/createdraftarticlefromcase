    <subject>Gartner Report: Hack Your Culture to Drive Quality and DevOps Success (18 Minute Read)</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

We invite you to read Gartner’s Hack Your Culture to Drive Quality and DevOps Success &lt;[[https://content.pivotal.io/analyst-reports/hack-your-culture-to-drive-quality-and-devops-success?utm_source=pivotal-email&amp;utm_medium=email-link&amp;utm_campaign=gartner-hack-your-culture-q318]]&gt; report.
Purchasing tools is not a substitute for adopting modern practices that lead to successful DevOps and transformation initiatives. Application leaders responsible for delivering digital business applications must reconsider their development culture. This Gartner report highlights practices that support successful DevOps initiatives, while addressing challenges that hinder it such as:



	- Lack of adoption due to deficiency funding for training and awareness campaigns.

	- Lack of understanding between developers and business requirements.

	- Lack of understanding of test-driven development and its value to developers.
